**Edit:**

I just woke up and I read all your constructive feedback. WOW, this is why I love Reddit sometimes. I will try and implement all the tips and tricks to my app.

Quick question (I woke up with this idea), if I wanted to add a dictionary to my app, to check if the word is a real word, is it easily achievable?

&#x200B;

**Background:**

I am a High School dropout and I have no degree. I started working in IT about 8 years ago and made my way to being a System Administrator for a small Supermarket chain. I am new to Python and the only language I know a little of is Powershell.

**Why I want to learn Python:**

There are not a lot of practical skills that I learned on my own. So on December 28th, I decided to put my energy into learning how to code. I saw a post in r/powershell : [Powershell Guide to Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/ab27n2/book_update_powershell_guide_to_python/) by  [u/Prateeksingh1590](https://www.reddit.com/user/Prateeksingh1590) and decided I wanted to learn Python. So I watched 2.5 hours out of the 4 hours from [this video for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=12978s). I also watched 2 hours of a [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) course, mainly reviewing what I had learned from [Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).

**The App:**

At one point, I wanted to know if I could code an app with the little basic knowledge I had. I thought about building an guessing word game. So I layed out want I wanted to achieve. I wanted the person guessing to have 3 information while guessing a word :

1 - To know if the have more, less or equal the characters of the word

2 - To know if they have some letters right

3 - To if the letters that are right are in the right spot

**Making the App:**

So I started my journey to make this app. It took me over a week and about 8-10 hours of trials and errors and googling to achieve the app. Watch out for yourself, it's pretty ugly. but it works.

**Feedback is more than welcome**

36,BEWXYVBSIHSAPJUK3XA3MXD3R,theymos,Don't invest recklessly,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/,"I posted about this [just a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jrl5o/unrealistic_volatility_expectations/), but I feel that it's necessary to repeat. The Bitcoin price is on an unbelievably ridiculous upswing which is rather likely to be a bubble. If you're trying to get rich quick by dumping your retirement funds into BTC at $10k, then your ""investment strategy"" is not much better than someone betting everything on a game of roulette. High-risk-high-reward investing is not *necessarily* bad, but you have to seriously look at your thought process to make sure that you're not:

* Being blinded by dreams of getting rich quickly, similarly to people who dump money on very-negative-EV lottery tickets.
* Getting wrapped up in ""HODL"" memes, reddit comments, and other groupthink, which is sometimes fun, **but absolutely the last appropriate source of investment advice**.
* Acting based on panic thinking like, ""OMG the price is going to $1 million and I will *miss my chance forever* if I don't buy *right now*"" or ""OMG the price is going to $0.01 and I will *miss my chance forever* to retain some value if I don't sell *right now*"".
* Investing more than you can afford to lose. **Bitcoin is HIGHLY, HIGHLY speculative**. No investment advisor would tell you to put all of your life savings into MSFT or whatever, and MSFT has a market cap 4x larger than Bitcoin. Although I *believe* that it is very unlikely, there are several ways in which the value could drop precipitously, even to zero. For example, there is *no mathematical proof* that the cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin are actually secure -- they are merely *believed* to be secure because nobody has been able to break them after many years of intense scrutiny. (I'm not here recommending ""diversifying"" into altcoins -- altcoins are almost all complete trash, and price-wise they follow BTC but with even more volatility, so they're not really useful for diversification.)

It is entirely possible that the massive price increase of the last year is based on lasting fundamentals. In addition to things like the fairly recent subsidy halving, the defeat of B2X, etc., the world fiat-based economy is in many ways on very shaky ground, and getting worse all the time. There are many good reasons why BTC should have a larger market cap than every fiat currency combined. It's even possible that the price will increase quite a bit more from now. But for goodness sake, don't think that Bitcoin is the first-ever infinite-money generator that will continue to rise exponentially forever (in real terms). I can nearly guarantee that **there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point**. Maybe it will be $10k to $5k, maybe it will be $50k to $30k, who knows. But if you're thinking for example that the current $5k+ price range is *absolutely secure* after only existing for a few months, then you're traveling blind through very dangerous territory.

Some points to consider:

* Buying near the ATH is very risky, and while it *can* be correct/profitable, it puts you on the wrong footing. You need to buy *low* and sell *high* to make money.
* On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13. That's a drop of 86.9%. Imagine this happens again: The price drops sharply to $2000 or something and then just continuously decreases down to a low of $1,432 (an 86.9% reduction from today's ATH) over the course of a *whole year*. I'm not saying that this *will* happen, but it's happened once and it *can* happen again. **Could you survive this?**
* Bitcoin is experimental, and it is probably imprudent for someone who is not a true believer in the *soul* of Bitcoin to invest a lot into it. For example, I personally wouldn't invest more than a few percent of my total assets into ETH even if I felt very confident that it would rise in price because I simply don't believe in its philosophy or long-term value.
* To reduce risk, it is frequently recommended to allocate assets by percentage, and rebalance upon large price movements. Eg. If you previously decided that you want to allocate 50% of your wealth in BTC (because you are a super big true believer), but BTC is now 90% of your wealth because the price increased so much, it may generally be advisable to start selling to rebalance your BTC allocation back down to 50%. I'm not saying that it is always absolutely wrong to have 90% of your assets in BTC or whatever, but it should be because you are intentionally *choosing* to do so, not because the price got away from you and you never really considered that you now have 90% of your wealth riding on one thing.
* Avoid panic buys and panic sells. Dollar-cost-averaging over a long period of time is often a good strategy.
* Nothing rises in real value to infinity. That's impossible. It is possible that 1 BTC could someday be worth infinite *dollars*, but that just means that dollars are worthless in that hypothetical scenario. BTC probably does have plenty of room to grow in real value before it completely takes over the world, but keep in mind that there *is* a ceiling.
* If BTC were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that'd probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. At some point in that price area, people around the world would probably lose substantial faith in fiat currencies. A good result, but ask yourself: do you expect the prevailing economic regime to *go down easily*?

I'm not telling you to buy or sell, and I'm not giving financial advice here. I'm just urging everyone to think rationally, not emotionally or recklessly.",1512030327

Due to outstanding teamwork by an additional eyewitness, CSUFPD Dispatchers and Police Officers, the peaceful arrest of this suspect, who is a non-student, was possible.**
 
Original October 4th Crime Alert:
On Tuesday, October 3rd, at approximately 3:26 p.m., CSU Fullerton Police Officers were dispatched to South Campus Drive near Dan Black Hall regarding a report of a male subject allegedly masturbating in his vehicle.  When officers arrived on scene, the suspect had left the area.  Officers subsequently interviewed a female student who told them that she was flagged down by the suspect who was sitting in a silver Toyota Camry.  The vehicle had a partial license plate number of ""5VW"".  The car was parked along the South Campus Drive round-a-bout.  As the student approached the car to hear what the suspect was saying, she noticed the individual was not wearing any pants and appeared to be masturbating.  The suspect then drove away and was last seen eastbound on Nutwood Avenue.  The suspect was described to the officers as possibly being ""of Middle Eastern descent"", in his 40's and wore a dark colored tee shirt.

Also one dollar here is worth 7 or 8 times the local currency, people who make 200$ to 400$ a month here are considered ""rich"" people. So travelling outside the country isn't an option not to mention that being from an unstable country will make it harder for you to get a visa.

do you guys usually think of them before a hackathon or is it more of a spur-of-the-moment creative idea you come up with?

I ask because I'm genuinely interested in hearing about the thought process among all those competing in a hackathon. for me, I personally try and think of an idea or a project ahead of time based off the hackathon's theme and if it doesn't work, I get creative in the moment with whichever group im working with. as I'm usually the only female in a hackathon group, I find that creativity also comes more naturally in the moment so I try my best to bring as much as I can to the table when they come up at any random time during the hackathon

125,DFA5ZO8K57RI7QQMWR771TM6V,FlexLikeAYogi,Feeling extremely discouraged at the rate that I am learning in my CS classes. What can I do?,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/9l6u9z/feeling_extremely_discouraged_at_the_rate_that_i/,"First and foremost, I would like to apologize for any grammatical or spelling errors. I'm in the middle of a study session and just need to vent a wee bit. 


To give some background: I know nothing about computer science. I come from parents who barely know how to turn on a computer, and no one else in my family that has encouraged me to explore technology. If you were to ask me a year ago, I would he one of those people who would assume Java was short for javascript (heh). Not really knowing what to do for college I decided to give CS a try, and I honestly love it. 

Fast forward to today, I am now completing my second CS class. In my first class, I spent countless hours with tutors and spent countless hours outside of class practicing on Codeacademy or any other outside sources to brush up. My first CS professor was terrible but I made every effort to keep up with the rest of the people in class. And yet, I passed with a 72 percent. Here I am, in my second class doing the same things I was doing last semester: extreme amounts of work for seemingly little result. My discouragement comes from seeing everyone else in the class already knowing the material before its taught, and realizing that I take twice as long for me to understand the concepts. I have a serious case of imposter syndrome despite my honest efforts and it almost feels like I dont belong. 

Has anyone else that has been in this position give any tips?

EDIT:  I just want to give a HUGE thanks for everyone that has commented. I cannot reply to everyone at this time because I must keep my head down in my books (or laptop), but I truly do appreciate what everyone had to say. Overall, I would like to thank you for your comments that gave me a different perspective on the situation for a positive outlook, sharing a personal experience,  and also reminding me of important aspects and advice as I go through my journey. My spirits have been lifted and I'm ready to embrace the struggle. Thank you to all. ",1538640560

→Hi Henry I'm trying to get an update on a missing withdraw from early in the week. It's been two days and nobody from support has contacted me

Henry: I see you already have an open support ticket with a supervisor. You're going to need to wait for a reply via email. Live chat cannot help, I'm afraid.

→Can you tell me when these people will respond? It feels like I'm being actively avoided

No response after that.

Withdrew $2490.38 on 3/21 10:20pm to BMO Harris account, never get an e-mail but money is taken out of coinbase account, never has hit my bank account

Withdrew $2809.49 on 3/22 7:29pm to Capital One 360 account, get an email saying 1-2 days, 2 days later money is in my account.

Am I mad to be anxious about this? I'd like to think that someone would respond from Coinbase to help me out on this. It's not a small sum for me either so I'd like to get it as soon as possible.

I've contacted support, I left a message in the community and twitter but all I here is the deafening silence.



**UPDATE**: **Just got this e-mail as there was a problem on their side which is what I thought, email below**

**Sorry for the trouble with this, there was a problem with the withdrawal as you noticed. I was able to cancel it, and the funds are now back in your USD wallet. You can withdraw whenever you like.**

I have an internship with Amazon for the summer, but it with the Data Center Operations divisions. So working with servers mostly. But I found a way to make an impression on my manager today using Python. I can't go into specific details of what we were working on (NDA and confidentiality and all) but I can talk about what I did. 

We were working with a large number of assets (327 total) and part of that work involved compiling information about those assets. Well as an intern I get all the crap jobs. So I got handed that job. So for 2 days, I've been working on compiling the info in a spreadsheet. Thought I was finished but found I only had information for 319 assets. Well, we can't just 'lose' 8 assets. That kind of looks bad on a record. So my manager wanted me to go through the list of total assets and figure out what 8 we didn't have info for. I'm like 99% sure he was expecting me to go line by line in excel and do a CTRL+F to see which ones from the total list weren't on the info list. A nice little process that would likely have taken me the better part of the day to accomplish.   

Instead, I pulled up python, threw together a script to build 2 lists (one for total assets, one for the information I had compiled) and then compare the lists. Anything it found in the totals list that it didn't find in the info list got dumped to a text file.  

Total time: 18 minutes (I had to look up some info on the xlswriter module).  

My manager literally said: ""How the hell did you do that?"" when I showed him the list 20 minutes after we spoke.",1560497889

230,DKLV3IXUOIUDOR607QUT0D8YF,Codeick,Second year CS major looking for help to point me in the right direction and finding what discipline to focus on,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6pwn8t/second_year_cs_major_looking_for_help_to_point_me/,"The fall semester of college is creeping around the corner. This will be my second year, however, I will be formally admitted into my major once my summer class is credited to me.

As much as I have been trying to find information, I cannot find all of the sub-fields that CS has to offer. I have found threads on this sub, but it hasn't resolved my lack of information. Ideally, I would like to be well rounded in most areas when I graduate. I find the CS field to be very interesting, for more than just coding. While I know absolutely nothing about it, I love playing around with networks and the stuff that most people don't typically see. I find it very interesting to understand how all of it works. I hear about courses I will have to take and I have no idea what it is.

I feel lost in my major. I have messed around with code very little before college, but the first time I have actually done something with it was from my programming course. It feels like all of these other people as far into the degree as me are so much more capable. They understand a lot of the sub-fields whereas I can really only answer to two, they know more about programming whereas I only know very elementary C++. For example, I didn't even know what SQL was, I still don't really get it, but it feels like everyone else knows what they're doing.

I want to be able to code, develop software, work with security, work with networks, set up databases, understand and create algorithms, all of it, I just don't know how to focus on an area, let alone fully understand the areas so I can determine which I enjoy the most. I hope to be rounded in all of the areas because I am genuinely interested in all of it and I believe that is what will point me in the right direction, but by the time I get enough experience with all of it I feel that it will be too late to choose electives for which sub-field I want to verse myself in more of.

People recommend working on projects and finding internships. I couldn't find an internship this summer, nobody wants someone who can only code very basic C++ that will run on a console. As far as projects go, I don't know what I could possibly work on that could be used in resumes and such given how much knowledge I lack in this area as of now. People keep suggesting to learn code online in my free time, but I don't know what language to start with and I always eventually hit a road block early on that I can never figure out because the information is not as detailed as I need it to be, instead, when I get stuck on certain functions of the language, I get sent down this rabbit hole of information and all of it is overwhelming because I don't know the general information. I don't mean for it to sound like I cannot solve problems, what I mean is that I don't have all of the fundamental ideas, I still don't know what database structures are for example, so it complicates things when hitting those roadblocks.

I just need help, some advice to point me in the right direction. I need to know what to do or who to talk to because I want to become very skilled in this area. I am passionate about it because it interests me so much, I want to do the right things to benefit myself as much as possible. Thank you for the help.",1501197865

My plan is to self-study intro comp sci for the next couple months, since I haven't taken a formal computer science course since high school (good resources would be greatly appreciated!), and then try to take either algorithms, data structures, or both at a local university over the summer. I live in Boston, so I've been looking on the BU webpage for summer courses, but I can't find anything that directly matches that description. Do any of the courses on here cover the material I'm looking for in those two classes? http://www.bu.edu/summer/courses/computer-science/

The Graph: 
I am using a grid like graph where i one after another add some edges. So the graph has about the same amount of edges and vertices and has no weight's nor is it directed. Before i add a new edge i want to check the distance between the 2 vertices i am Connecting and later decide on that result whether or not i want to add this Edge. 

My question is, is there a Data structure that allows me to find the Distance between vertices in less then O(N^2) (wich would be just a BFS for the other Vertex)? That Data structure of course still needs to hold after i added a few edges. If possible i would like to have a space Complexity of O(N).

If you have any ideas i would really like to hear them.

(The last thing i looked into was a disjoint set used in the Kruskal algorithm. With this i can check quickly whether two vertices are connected through a path or not)

Edit:
Practical Description of what i want to do:

I am creating a dungeon generating algorithm that is based on Kruskall. You have a essentially Bool matrix wich says whether or not a Tile is walkable or not. Now i want that the algorithm creates cycles if they have a certain size. So if a add a new walkable tile i need to check whether or not i am creating a cycle and then check how long the cycle.",1580404548

I recently started working with C/C++ and I got to be honest, it's a nightmare. I understand the syntax and can code pretty well. The problem starts with different build systems and platform specific stuff. I undestand that to make something cross-platform I can use preprocessor #ifndef and all that stuff. But I am not confortable with all the different ""building and compiling stuff"" 

For example, with javascript I know that all i need is npm or yarn and stuff to organize the dependencies and porting it to a new OS is just one command away. With C/C++ there are different build tools, eg. ninja and make. And build tools for build tools (Cmake). There is the mess of  static and dynamic libraries that need to be linked depending on OSes. This is just so overwhelming. 

I can't make a decision. I am trying to make a game engine for the purpose of understanding the internals of games and it's a pain. I accept that this is what I HAVE to deal with if I want to even consider doing cross-platform in C/C++. It's the part of what makes it hard. I get it.

I really want to sink my teeth in this.  I want to know how do I build cross-platform stuff in C/C++ from begining to end. Testing, debugging, using other libraries. I want to stay away from IDEs like visual studio and all (part of the reason i looked into cmake). My objective is to understand the code BETWEEN the algorithms that make up a program. I want to know how things are organized in a project. how large projects like cocos-2dx handle all the testing and supporting compilation on different OSes (not a gamebuilt with cocos but cocos itself).

Now, that I have got that out of the way. What I want to know from you all is this: Is there a guide or a book that shows how large codebases in C/C++ are made? Obviously one book cannot cover this all. I need proper resources that guide me through all of this. I don't care if it's videos, books, posts etc. Are there some open source projects that are easy but complex enough to help me understand this all? How should I proceed to undersand this?",1565892581

I get why BTC and others are swinging like they are. I get the mechanics behind it. That's fine. 

What I don't understand is the empty talk...not just here, but everywhere. To the moon, FUD, the ""real"" bitcoin, attacks, scams, villains. Who gives a shit? If you think rich boys won't play rich boy games, you're naive. It happens in every industry and usually the best solution wins in the end...but the rich always get richer in the process.

In the end, what matters? The technology and its adoption/acceptance/utility. I have to dig 10x harder to find out what the technology roadmaps look like than I do to find out who big bad Roger is and details of his evil plans. Who gives a shit about that guy (or any of the other players)? Does b*cash have actual tangible plans to be successful? If so, I'd love a place to see those plans and make my own decisions. I've seen a lot of upcoming BTC developments (and the obligatory ""yea in 18 months"" replies), but that shows me there are plans and strategies for the next level of the technology. I understand that solid technology requires time to build and implementing a half-baked solution would equal failure. To be the biggest, you can't have those risks. Your big money investors won't tolerate it.

Oh, Chinese miners somewhat control and sway things and have a monopoly on the ASIC miners? Do we not have the ability to build these (likely in a better, faster, more efficient way)? Everybody is just pointing fingers and crying instead of providing guidance and insight.

Oh, transaction fees are too high and the ""market"" doesn't like it?  Well, from the way it seems, 90% of the newly invested money is here for the rollercoaster, unrelated to the technology. The ""older"" money here knows how useful this tech is. Not to mention - if the fees are that significant, can we not get this community involved in supporting education and development? Adoption of segwit addresses reduces fees, right? Are there things we can collectively do to help delivery of LN, Schnorr, other efforts? Let's be a solution to these problems instead of just regurgitating the problems all day. It's like watching CNN or Fox News while trying to actually get educated - won't happen. 

People are also caught up in the religion of Satoshi's ""vision"" which, like anything else, would naturally evolve as the product and technology evolves. Steve Jobs didn't plan on the iPhone on day 1 either, but if you said iPhone in his early days, you'd be against Steve's ""vision"". I don't know....just calm down.

TL,DR: Do you believe in your technology or not? If so, let the power players pay themselves with power moves. Chickens always come home to roost. Let's be educated and united in our belief of the technology. The price will be what we deserve in the end.

1. When I was in Housing I was being harrassed and Housing told me there was no room to move me. Had to jump chain to the Dean and miraculously there was another apartment available. I couch surfed and slept in my car for a month while my abusive roommate had the entire room and Housing claimed they were full. Never told me about the Emergency Housing.  

2. Then the next semester I got accused of cheating by a stupid TA and I fought it, but couldn't continue to because she did it 2 weeks before summer started. Her department took her side even though I had proof I didn't cheat. Still got put on probation...

Hi all,

As a Computer Scientist and an electronic passionate, I was always intrigued by the complexity of computer architectures and I always wondered if I could build a CPU myself from scratch. There are so many smart devices and constantly increasingly complex circuits and computing devices coming out every day that we are now used to consider this technology as a black box, impossible to replicate or even understand at a fine level.

This is the motivation behind my home-made 8bit CPU project I designed and built during the past weeks as the COVID-19 situation gave me a bunch of spare time. Moreover, this is also the first time I designed my own PCB so it was a double fun experience.

The peculiarity of this project is that it is entirely composed of simple logic circuits (74HCT ICs), with no microprocessors or complex parts. 

The key feature of this CPU is that it is fully debuggable and shows you what’s happening in the CPU at any time. You can input simple programs by hand and go through the execution step-by-step by manually pulsing the clock and see how the signals and data flow through the CPU to accomplish the given operation.

I think this is a quite powerful learning tool if you’re interested in how computers and computation work, especially because it turned out to be way more complicated once you face the implications of dealing with impedance, the inductance of the circuit and other basic electronic problems that were not addressed by the initial schematic.

At the moment I built the version 1 of the CPU, I have already fixed up some little problems I encountered on the way and improved the design with version 2, already available on GitHub. There you can find all the schematics and PCB layout in KiCad format, as well as the code, a demo video and a bit of explanation.

Here you can find a demo of the CPU in action solving a variety of problems such as the Fibonacci sequence, finding prime numbers and sorting.

Lets get to it!

1. Go to GDAX.com and log in with your Coinbase account. GDAX is owned by Coinbase, and it’s their platform for more technical people. 

2. After you logged in, verify your account if necessary. 

3. Press the “deposit” button and then deposit your Bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet. It’s free and takes only seconds. 

4. Press the “withdraw” button, then open the “BTC address” tab and put the address you wish to send your bitcoins to in there. 

That’s it! You have sent your bitcoins to another address and avoided some serious fees.

438,BRFIH3EODDEJ27053EK0B813R,ItsGentle,10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/,"While I consider myself an amateur trader and a small-scale investor, over the 2+ years of trading crypto I've learned some things I'd like to share with you all, but mostly with those who are making their first steps into the uncharted cryptoland. 

1. Just as with anything else in life, **trading cryptocurrencies is context dependent**. That means you should remain a healthy sceptic about general truths, universal rules and things that ""everyone knows"". Consider the famous ""buy low sell high"" dictum. The definition of high and low is subjective in most cases since it depends on your timescale, goals and trading strategy. If you’re a hodler, as are many of the fellow redditors here, your high and low will differ dramatically compared to the day trader's.

2. It is for the same reason that **bulls and bears don't really matter**. Whether you're 'bullish' or 'bearish' depends on your strategy and timescale. Consider this: to someone hodling BTC since 2013 a dip here or there (even a prolonged one) makes little difference because the price of BTC over the time continues to grow monstrously – you can call it one long-term bull market.

3. At some point, you'll bump (or you already have) into something that is called 'technical analysis'. Let me save you some time (and money, probably) by telling you this: **technical analysis is neither technical, nor is it very analytical**. While many traders regard TA to be a scientific way (supposedly based on mathematics) to read and predict the market moves, TA has little to do with any formal science. Differently from the surrounding physical world, we are not aware of any physical laws that govern our human behavior, including markets. If it was possible to mathematically calculate and with certainty predict market moves, the big buck guys in Wall Street would have already done it. Think about the major financial crises for a moment – just like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody (well, almost nobody) ever expected one. Does it mean TA –  trends, chart patterns, MACD, RSI, Elliot wave count, etc. – is a complete rubbish? I wouldn't go as far as to claim that. It is somewhat helpful – if only a little, TA still gives you a feel of the current market mood. TA also does one other thing pretty accurately: it graphically represents historic data of human behavior in the financial markets. Surely you can benefit from that? Or do you? This brings me to another point...

4. **Beware of historical analogies and 'I knew it all along' thing**. As humans, we are prone to hindsight bias, a tendency, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been easily predictable. We are all blinded by hindsight bias because our brain looks for simplistic linear link between cause and effect. This way when an unexpected event happens, the brain uses the knew-it-all-along mode to cope with cognitive dissonance and make sense of the surrounding world. While trading hindsight bias harms you in two ways: a) it drains you psychologically for not making 'the right' decisions in the past, and by luring you into oversimplified historic analogies, b) it creates a false sense of investment security at the present time. Just look at everyone complaining they've sold their BTC at the worst possible time (as a matter of fact, I am no different – I still autodestructively loathe my decision to liquidate a large portion of my BTC portfolio after the BTC price hiked to 8k). It is also very tempting to think you wouldn't miss 'the next bitcoin'. The problem is, though, that it is incredibly difficult if at all possible to spot such an opportunity. You have to be either lucky or extremely well informed (and lucky) to capitalize early on such opportunity. In reality, it's very difficult to differentiate between useless information (noise) and something that truly matters (signal). Which brings me yet to another point...

5. **Stop being a news junkie and start filtering what you read/hear/see**. If you don't, at some point in time the quantity of consumed news will start to impact your decisions and it will begin to negatively correlate with the net gain of your investment portfolio. Instead of reading news nonstop, better educate yourself – dive deep into the market fundamentals and the technology you're dealing with. This way it will be easier for you to spot new lucrative investment opportunities when the time comes.

6. **Accept the fact that idiots also happen to make lots of money and move on**. Multiple times too, if they're lucky ones. However, the net worth of (lucky) idiot doesn't mean you should imitate him and become one. Some two months ago a Dutch father of two young children sold his family's house, bought BTC and other cryptocurrencies, and relocated his family to a rented property. After the recent spike in BTC price the guy's net worth must have increased substantially. So, is he an idiot? Absolutely! It is only a question of time before he ruins his own and his family's life with some incredibly reckless financial decision.

7. **Try to understand the motives governing your decisions and act (or don't act) accordingly**. If your actions are about to be driven by extreme emotions such as fear, panic or excitement – stop immediately and reevaluate the situation. Otherwise you'll end up belonging to the FOMO buyer/panic seller club aka the money losers. If you want to stay on the earning side long term, you must keep your head cool and think clearly.

8. **Day trading is probably not for you**. Consider this: evidence in neuroscience research shows that we are a loss-averse species. For this we should thank our stone age ancestors who had barely enough food, shelter and belongings to survive in a very adverse world. Losing even a little of what they had meant their existence was in jeopardy. This explains why contemporary humans prefer avoiding financial loss to making financial gain. Neuroscientists claim that losing money activates the same area of the brain that responds to mortal danger. This is why in order to do day trading you must have A LOT of self-control and balls of steel – there are many ups and downs during a single day. It drains you emotionally, you end up being addicted to adrenaline, your fiancée hates it, and the hodlers will probably outperform you in the long run anyway.

9. **Volatility is your friend**. Over time BTC volatility makes the coin stronger, not weaker. While wild swings in price makes BTC almost impossible to use as a currency, volatility is good from the financial asset point of view. Traders and investors dealing with BTC get used to huge and sudden price hikes and dips. Unlike for any 'stable' stock of any prominent multinational corporation, even substantial and unexpected shocks will not undermine the confidence in BTC. BTW, best of luck to everyone planning to short BTC. :)

10. **Make small mistakes, learn from them, get wiser, err less**. In your childhood days, you needed the experience of burning your hand with fire so that for the rest of your life you wouldn't need to think about the painful experience. That information is now hardwired in your brain and helps you to avoid getting harmed. If you've just started trading crypto, expect to make mistakes and prepare to learn from them. It's only after you get into FOMO, get panicked big time, take too big a risk, get out too early only to jump in at the worst possible time, ONLY and ONLY then you'll start to improve.

Now that I'm somewhere with a bit more recognition and more advanced computer classes, I'm starting to apply for summer internships. However, I'm *absolutely* terrified and feel like I'm not cut out for any of them! :( I lost a bunch of credits when I transferred and will be doing an extra semester most likely, so I'm planning on applying to local internships for this summer and more prestigious  internships for next... But even the local internships scare me lol

I've done well in all of my comp sci classes so far (although one or two of the prereqs like physics, etc were roooough), and up until this semester I *thought* I had amassed a decent amount of experience programming my own neopets-esque site in middle school/high school. 

But also, as I've advanced to upper level classes I've started to realize how much I *don't* know + how much my code sucked then/sucks now, and it's mildly terrifying lol. And so the idea of actually working in computer science terrifies me, to the point where I've debated not working in programming despite the fact that it's something I'm obviously interested in :/ I'd like to think a lot of it is because I'm a woman in STEM, but at least 45% of my school's comp sci department is female so eh lol 

Did anyone else feel the same way or is currently feeling the same way? Any words of encouragement? :(

Hope you're all having a nice Tuesday! So recently I went and saw my academic adviser regarding Computer Science and what if I decided to switch. Turns out I have lots of time to make a decision, and I don't really need to choose until the beginning of 2nd year, if I want to change majors.

The only thing really is just I have some fears about the program. I've read online, like on Quora, etc. that if you weren't A) Programming at like 4 years old, and B) If you didn't get A's in math, don't even bother.

As some of you may know from me posting here, I will be taking a CS elective next semester, but I'm worried that even if I do like it, and I do switch into CS, that I will do bad in all the other classes, like Intro to Programming, and all the upper year classes.

As for math, I don't need Calculus surprisingly. I need ""Graphs, Functions, Geometry"" and ""Sets, Logic, Number Theory"" at the 100 level and then Matrix Algebra in 2nd year. (I'm doing a BA, so the other maths aren't required.)

But I got Bs in high school math, and a whopping C- in Grade 12, last year

I just don't want to make a mistake and then fail out of school because its too hard for me or something, but I also don't want to earn a degree (my current, Kinesiology) where I don't even think I could do any tech, considering I wouldn't qualify for any tech related Masters.

Do you want low tx fees, because this is how you get low tx fees",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ojt5f/day_7_i_will_post_this_guide_regularly_until/,"**TL/DR**

Bitcoin users can help lower transaction fees and improve bitcoin by switching to SegWit addresses and encourage wallets/exchanges to do the same.

**SUMMARY**

Segregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work on integrating it. Others, such as Zebpay in India [have already implemented SegWit](https://blog.zebpay.com/how-zebpay-reduced-bitcoin-transaction-fees-a9e24c788598) and are reaping the benefits of reduced transaction fees. If bitcoin users demand SegWit now it will temporarily relieve the transaction backlog while more even more advanced solutions such as Lightning are developed.

Batching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it.

There is an opportunity now for all bitcoin users to individually contribute to help strengthen and improve the bitcoin protocol. At this point, the process requires a bit of work/learning on the part of the user, but in doing so you'll actually be advancing bitcoin and leaving what could turn out to be a multi-generational legacy for humanity.

**MEMPOOL/SEGWIT STATISTICS**

- [BitInfoCharts.com - Average Transaction Fees](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) - $32USD per Tx
- [Blockchain.info - Unconfirmed Transactions](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) - 170K unconfirmed Tx's
- [SegWit Charts](http://segwit.party/charts/) - 10% SegWit Tx's

__________________________


**BACKGROUND**

On Dec 18 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. 

Why is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?

- SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn't been a priority.

Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?

- Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.

What determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?

- Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

 [Source: HowToToken](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

- Draw your own conclusions based on their own words: 

 [March 2016 - Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reservations about Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)

**P2SH/bech32 FAQs**

What are the two SegWit address formats and why do they exist?

- It's been a challenge for wallet developers to implement SegWit in a way that users can easily and without too much disruption migrate from legacy to SegWit addresses. The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses – Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress – use so-called “nested P2SH addresses.” This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address – starting with a “3” – and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to existing wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.

 Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.

  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)

What is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?

- P2SH starts with ""3...""

 bech32 starts with ""bc1...""
 
Which addresses can I send from/to?

- P2SH Segwit addresses can be sent to using older Bitcoin software with no Segwit support. This supports backwards compatibility

 bech32 can only be sent to from newer Bitcoin software that support bech32. Ex: Electrum

 [Source: BitcoinTalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2347427.msg23976364#msg23976364)

Why did ThePirateBay put up two Bitcoin donation addresses on their frontpage, one bech32 and one not? 

- The address starting with a ""3..."" is a P2SH SegWit address that can be sent BTC from any bitcoin address including a legacy address. The address starting with a ""bc1..."" is a bech32 SegWit address that can only be sent to from newer wallets that support bech32.

Please remember to stick to the facts and avoid speculation. I’ll try to update consistently throughout it. 

Update: Refunds and reimbursements will NOT be happening for the Spring 2020 semester, as per President Virjee.

Update: Fall 2020 being fully online was a false report and a “misrepresentation”, says Provost Oliver. She states that “what we want to do is follow what the governor says, and what the Chancellor’s office says”, and that it’s important to keep in mind that “things can change very quickly” 

Update: Internships, visual arts, research, and lab classes will have “priority” for being instituted face-to-face first when classes resume, if that is a possibility. Oliver still states that while the circumstances are not optimal, “I’m afraid I have to give a generic answer- it depends. I know that answer is unsatisfactory to all of you.”

Update: on the Titan Experience- VP for student affairs, Mr. Le Grand, states that “fullerton.edu/students” has information on how clubs and organizations may continue to meet. In regard to the emergency funding for students states that even though the campus will get $41 million as a result of the CARES act, “we don’t have a check yet” and to “be patient” as we “look for ways to get the money to students once it actually happens.” Also encourages students in need to reach out to Tuffy’s Basic Needs service. 

Update: Commencement- due to social distancing requirements, they are “running scenarios” and state that it is “tough managing the unknown” but that “it is our goal to have every student walk across the stage when that becomes available”. No date is given, but “at some point” it will happen. Right now, a virtual celebration is being discussed. It’s “exciting,” that “we will be able to have something this spring”, states Greg Saks about this virtual option.

Update: 37 minutes in, moderator Ellen Treanor states “we have addressed most questions” and has the panel share their final thoughts.

Update: Dr. Amir Dabirian, VP of Information Technology states that “technology” should not be an issue for students and that should you need any tech, they will try their best to coordinate that and ship it to you.

Update: Dean of Students Hallie Hunt says “if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us, we are here for you.”

Update: Provost Oliver thanks all students “for sticking with their education while facing stress of academics, life, and family. Congratulations for sticking with your education. We will be able to answer specific questions about Credit/No Credit if you submit them to the website.” She thanks the Academic Senate and states that she hopes this will help take some of the stress off. “I appreciate the gratitude that you have for us. We are working as hard as we can because we believe in you. You’ll probably hate me for this, but I hope you’ll be able to write a few of your thoughts during this time. This is a very unusual time in history, but trust me, take some notes and it’ll be a good time soon enough to share that with your grandchildren.”

Update: President Virjee- “if students need a laptop, or mobile WiFi space, a cellphone, a charger, we will help you out on that.” States that if you have IT problems, to please use the IT website to navigate those concerns.
“I think we have the most friendly grading option anywhere in the country”- states that we have a ten day period after we see our grade, we can then make an “informed decision”, states that those looking at grad school, student athletes, and those receiving financial aid should speak to academic advisors but that ultimately, “it is your decision, that is in your hands.”

Update: President Virjee says “we have the best attendance in class now than ever” and that he is proud of how “inspiring” we are to the “next generation of Titans that are coming in” and that we have tenacity, kindness, and grit. “In other words, it takes a Titan!”
“I want to shake your hand when you cross that stage.”
President Virjee just got slightly emotional and had to pause for a moment after his voice broke. He states that “we will get through this together.”

Update: Virtual Town Hall just ended, 53 minutes after it started. Sound off below y’all, it may not be much but at the very least we’ve got each other.",1587629756

1. I can't take any actual artificial intelligence classes at my uni until my senior year. Are there any websites that offer free online classes/tutorials for how to get started? (p.s. - I'm not asking for something to 'teach' me artificial intelligence online, I understand that it's not as simple as doing an online tutorial/class. I'm just trying to set myself up with the basics.)

2. What classes that AREN'T in computer science should I consider taking? (such as math classes, anything I would need to understand artificial intelligence). 

3. I'm currently working towards a Bachelor's degree. If/when I complete that, should I go for my Master's? Would that be necessary for finding a job in AI?",1532906980

So we were wondering is there maybe an open-source for what he did. Or maybe do you offer any advice on how we could do something like this. The game seems simple and looks like something made with Scratch. But I don't know how data collecting would be done. Also is there like a published research of what he did or just like anything that would help.

If you are trying to get this class, avoid the instructor William McCarthy. From all my courses, he is without a doubt the worst teacher I've ever had. I am not speaking of this out of bias or spite; my current grade in his class is a solid A. With less than half a semester to go, I have learned little to nothing in regards to how AI works.

The project he assigns is far beyond our capabilities. It must be written in Python, meet a list of very specific criteria, and be completed within a short timeframe. Don't have experience with Python? Tough luck. He will not teach you; all he does is suggest Python intro books for you to read. Stuck on certain parts of the project? More readings. The most you can do is follow the reading, copy the provided code word-for-word, and hope it works. This is not learning.

If you ask him for help, he refers you back to the reading. If you ask for an explanation, he will provide a meaningless response. Below is a piece of code that he was asked to explain. We were expected to not only understand it, but also be able to write it all out from memory, as it could be on the midterm (which it was). Here is the response he pretty much gave us:

>Okay, so first you import the necessary libraries. Then parse the arguments, load the dataset, and normalize from 0 to 1. Create the label names, and make a model for training. You fit the model, generate predictions, and plot the results.

Well no shit sherlock? It's as if he looks at the code and reads a key word from each section. His replies are plainly obvious and not helpful whatsoever. It's similar to me going outside and saying, ""The sky is blue."" We were never taught this MiniVGGNet model. It was not in our readings, nor was it used in our project. He just gave a brief overview of it and said it may very well be on our exam.

In addition to the projects, which are already on a tight deadline, he gives articles that we must read, analyze, and write an essay about. It's just filler work, and has no purpose other than to take time away - time that could have been used to polish up our project. The articles simply discuss the origins of AI, and how it has advanced in the past decades. He grades them harshly and expects us to mention specific topics, even though there was no rubric or requirements provided. It was literally labeled as ""Summary"" assignment.

I'm not a special snowflake complaining about him though. There are many other students who have expressed their distaste in him. He assigns a large amount of work, but skips office hours, and doesn't respond to student emails. Here are a few quotes from students in our class Discord chat:

580,C1K2P7U35XILMDGODREYUMMQF,soytendies,I am mining in the suburbs using 100% hydropower from my backyard creek and supplementing with backup power from hamster wheels. I am profitable AMA.,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6kno7l/i_am_mining_in_the_suburbs_using_100_hydropower/,"I have 1 microhydro plant running 24/7 in Braggadocio, Missouri. I have twenty-five hundred hamster wheels inside these greenhouses. All hamsters are running 100% off fair trade coffee, with soul cycle music pumped through small speakers in a surround-sound-system-setup playing non-stop.

I posted my numbers for this mining operation a few hours ago but it was downvoted into obscurity. Here is a link of the first hamster I had working this job if anyone is interested:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkNTAiWX8g0

His name was Mr. Geppetto, and he was the Genesis Hamster.

Anyhow, I kinda think that this sub is controlled by Jihan and Roger. I want to test this out to see if it might be true. Cuz...maybe I am just being weird and got it wrong. For the record, I am often right.
So here it goes...I have documented my mining operation over the last week here on Reddit. I detailed my idea from when it was just an idea all the way to today, where I have a fully functional and profitable bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the Missouri....not connected to the grid at all. I am about to go all-in and buy 1,000,000 miners for the September shipment of new S10's.

Here are the numbers for mining, for those of you who are interested. You will need 1 microhydro plant. And you will need 2500 hamster wheels, or alternatively one very large hamster wheel and a black bear. And a power control system. I buy the batteries from Walmart for $99 each, I keep the receipt an return them after 29 days. Total cost for the off grid hydro/hamster solution is $350. It costs so little because I'm also getting royalties from my onecoin investment. I am happy to share the suppliers with anyone who is interested (please clap).

I make 7 btc per day from each hamster. This is about 17500btc per day. I'm not calculating my profit because I'm not trying to cause the price to drop. 

I am pretty sure that there are LOTS of hamster trainers doing this and they don't want anyone else doing it. They are afraid of flooding sewer system with hamster poop pellets like the hog farms have done in Duplin County and across the States. And they are afraid of increasing demand for hamster food. And I am pretty sure those people are now running this sub. But again, maybe I am wrong. We'll see...
Basically, I feel that there is a real effort to dissuade people from bonding with hamsters and using hydropower so that miners can continue to do this.

I purchase one hamster and secure the lowest pricing per hamster. We do not employ guinea pigs. They are lazy. If one hamster listens to any song by Sade (or for the thug hamsters Poetic Justice by Kendrick) for more than 5 minutes they will make sweet hamster love and 100 baby hamsters will be born within a few days and I can resell the surplus hamsters on craigslist. 

By breeding hamsters myself I am making sure I am getting the best thorough bred, strongest, fastest hamsters, and no Guinea pigs. I also profit from dressing the charismatic ones in costumes and renting them out to birthday parties and corporate events for $79.99 an hour per hamster. Also in case you're wondering, I match 100% each hamster's contribution to his or her IRA. This isn't a sweatshop.

I have NO idea why this happens, but every time I post about hamsters and talk about how I have found what I believe to be an awesome idea for anyone who loves animals and lambos, I am down voted and called a liar and con man by a lot of people here.

So, I am testing my hypothesis. I think that one of three things will happen to this post: (1) it is down voted to obscurity (2) I am relentlessly called out for being a liar and con man (3) no one cares.
For the record, this should be a post that is read by many people here. I am not trying to say that it is the most amazing thing that someone will read here. But, this is exactly the type of post that should have people discussing in a bitcoin forum.

Anyhow, for those who are interested, this info is not a FAKE POSTING. The numbers are real. I am highly profitable. I wish others would do the exact same thing. I want everyone to be raising hamsters and using hydropower.

I accept btc donations to continue hamster advocacy at

If you guys like it, we'll build it.",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1sqznf/im_one_of_the_developers_of_honey_a_browser/,"I am one of the cofounders of [Honey](http://www.joinhoney.com), a browser extension that automatically searches and applies coupon codes for online shoppers at checkout.  I'm also a fan of bitcoins and its disruptive potential.

One of the biggest weakness of bitcoins at the moment is the lack of merchant support - especially large online retailers like Amazon. Unfortunately, it's a hard sale to get merchants to introduce a new payment concept to people who are about to checkout -- this could cause people to abandon the cart to go off to read about what this ""bitcoin"" thing is. Unless there's compelling evidence that the reward is greater than the risk, merchants like Amazon will not take that chance. 

We have an idea for adding a feature in Honey that can help prove the value of bitcoin as a payment method to giants like Amazon.  The user experience goes like this:

* You are checking out on Amazon
* If you have Honey installed, you will see a ""pay with bitcoins"" button on the page
* Hit the button and you will be asked to pay the total in bitcoins. The payment is sent to Honey
* When the bitcoin payment is confirmed, Honey applies an Amazon gift card in the exact amount to your shopping cart
* Your balance is now $0 and you complete the purchase

[See the step by step mock-up](http://imgur.com/a/UnKc8)

Honey is simply selling you an Amazon gift card for bitcoins, like Gyft.  The difference is in the user experience.  The same technology we're using to automatically apply coupon codes can be used to apply gift cards, and it makes the experience frictionless.  It should feel exactly the same as paying for something with your CC.

Some additional benefits:
 
* We will be introducing the concept of bitcoins to our 700K users, potentially bringing many of them into the ecosystem
* We will collect and publish data about volume and checkout completion rates as reference for large retailers

We are a tiny team of developers so we don't want to commit the time to building something like this unless we know people want it.  We would love to hear your feedback and if there's enough demand for it, we will build it.

EDIT: formatting

EDIT2: Wow, we are floored by the feedback and the support.  It looks like we're going to have to build it or we might risk losing our kneecap.  We'll be putting the development plans in motion first thing tomorrow.  We'll be posting updates on Twitter [@savehoney](https://twitter.com/SaveHoney) periodically.

Python 101 was written as an introduction to the Python programming language. While it is intended for beginners, some have claimed that they needed more hand-holding than this book provided for them. So I currently recommend it as an introductory and intermediate book for developers that are looking to learn Python.

When I originally wrote the book, I noticed that there were few or no books available that described how to create executables of your code or distribute your code via Python’s Package Index (PyPI). Python 101 covers these topics as well as introducing the reader to Python’s standard library, how to install 3rd party packages and an introduction to some of the most popular 3rd party packages for Python, such as SQLAlchemy, requests and virtualenv.

Python 101 has **5 sections, 44 chapters and 295 pages**.

You can get Python 101 for free on Leanpub using the following link: http://leanpub.com/python_101/c/48hours

If you happen to have a [Gumroad](https://gum.co/bppWr) account, then you’ll be able to get the book free there as well by using the following offer code: **48hours**

You will get the **PDF**, **epub** and **mobi** versions of the book. You can see a full table of contents on the Leanpub site

If you like my first book, you can get its sequel, **Python 201: Intermediate Python** for **50%** off here: http://leanpub.com/python201/c/50percent

I hate my fellow computer science classmates.,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/,"I need to get this off my chest, so please read my entire post instead of downvoting me based on my arrogant title. 

I am a computer science undergrad myself. I've always been fascinated with computers and the Internet ever since I was young. I simply cannot see myself working outside of this area - the incredible space for innovation and the power of exponential technologies is, to me, simply the most exciting thing I can think of. I constantly read about future technologies (shoutout to /r/Futurology) and find it disappointing that not many people share this admiration of mine, especially in this fantastic time period in which we live.

I could spend hours talking about why I chose to study computer science, but I'll leave that for some other time. I need to talk about why I dislike my peers.

I am definitely an introvert, but in my class of initially 50 people* I was probably the most outgoing. I haven't made many friends in college, which truly made me sad in the beginning because I could see myself making more (and better) friends if I were to study pretty much anything else. The only thing that me and 90% of my classmates have in common is that we, for different reasons, chose to study CS. Most of these people are your typical anime-loving gamers, which is of no interest to me. Most of them plan on focusing on game development, which is fine, but they simply don't have an open mind for other ideas an technologies. They play games and want to make games, as if that is even a realistic scenario. 

I don't even need to mention most of them are awkward as hell. This is no reason for me to dislike any of them, but it definitely makes it more difficult for me to bond with them. I have one good friend who shares common interests with me and doesn't act awkward at all. My other friends are nice people and (sometimes) good to hang out with, but they are definitely weird. I almost forgot to mention there is only one girl in my class, which really disappoints me, but I can't say I don't comprehend.

I feel like we need more people in CS who are also interested in the arts and humanities, as I see this as an important trait for understanding the power of the technologies we deal with. As Steve Jobs said it, ""Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science, I like that intersection. There’s something magical about that place.""

I think it is important to note that I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this is based on my point of view, I don't want to generalize CS students. I guess in a more developed country more people would be interested and open to the possibility of studying CS, and therefore providing more diversity among students. And that is exactly what I would like to see.

I hope I haven't offended any readers in any way with my personal thoughts. I'm just very passionate about technology and can't seem to get the same vibe from the people I deal with on a daily basis.

*I would say 50% of the people who started college with me already quit. Every semester some people leave, and we only had 2 (TWO) people graduating in CS last semester. But CS is hard, nothing new here.

A cheap teleprompter later, and I have my first final video up, complete with show notes.

The YouTube playlist is here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11nC9fSzAv14SG2BUJvQejRlfIQlFGuy

The show notes are here: https://hackingden.com/videos/introduction-to-digital-computers/

The show notes--including the circuit diagrams and BOM--are here: https://hackingden.com/videos/quick-videos/quick-videos-gates/

I've seen lightning transaction gifs and videos over and over. Today, I decided to fire up a lightning node on my laptop and give it a shot.

I followed [this](https://medium.com/@ajs1287/setting-up-bitcoin-lightning-network-node-on-macos-is-peanuts-eclair-5afbef553d71) walk-through for mac (I adapted it to Arch Linux) for setting up Bitcoin TestNet Node with Eclair Lightning (it's practically the same as Mac, except for the installation process).  
Running on Arch caused the problem of accidentally installing the latest dev version of Bitcoin Core ([AUR:bitcoin-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bitcoin-git/)) - also had some compilation issues because upstream moved some files and this hadn't been updated in the PKGBUILD.  

The latest dev version of Bitcoin Core included the SegWit address generation by default, which was very nice, didn't have any bugs using it in the brief period I used it.  

After a couple of hours of syncing the TestNet blocks on my laptop, I started up Eclair and got Eclair and Bitcoin Core connected (had to use `bitcoin-qt --deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress`becuase Eclair calls a soon-to-be deprecated function), sent myself some tBTC, and started opening up channels.  
Once I had about 3 channels open, I went to everyone's favorite [online coffee shop](https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/) and rewarded myself with some imaginary coffee.  

My mind was absolutely blown at how fast the transaction went through and how insanely low the fees were (10 sat).  

I went to test a transaction with a couple more hops, bought myself an imaginary 100eur Steam voucher, paid 100 sat in fees, near instant transaction (my Eclair client took a couple seconds to find a route to bitrefill)

Lightning truly is an incredible addition to Bitcoin, big things are coming.  

tl;dr - Saw a couple lightning transaction videos and gifs, didn't really sink in how amazing this really is, decided to give it a shot on linux, mind=blown  

**Edit:** I've done a little further testing and noticed that Eclair doesn't warn you if you're opening a duplicate channel (open a second channel with the same node)",1516322906

What I mostly think sparked those is a video on youtube talking how a team might accidentally build an AI for a certain purpose that would get fed too much data and it would take over our world in an absurd way.

&#x200B;

*Now don't get me wrong I'm not specifically afraid of AI* but I started switching from Google to DuckDuckGo and from Microsoft to Linux based OS' probably mostly because of all the hate for data abuse.While I still think collecting data has many many great improvement purposes I feel like I'm missing something important that everyone is panicking about.

&#x200B;

**After listing a few pros and cons of giving out data I'd like to ask you a few questions:**

**- Pros:**

* Giving out data lets improve the services I'm using
* It allows for a free web
* Personalized ads are better than some random ones. (i.e. job ads)

\- **Cons:**

* The competing services are subpar
* Allows for abuse of my data
* Companies are putting more and more backdoors into the software

&#x200B;

*I am aware that selling data and using it to improve own services are two different things. Also it's the governments' job to regulate and protect the data with laws, however things are as they are and the main question is should I battle the internet for privacy*

&#x200B;

**My questions are:**

* **Why is putting backdoors into software considered immoral and what are the best argument against this** (for business and personal use)
* Are my concerns about data being abused valid
* Should I put in the effort to go off the grid and become anonymous or is the convenience I get worth th*e personal data\** I give out to Google or Microsoft (is this a win-win situation perhaps)
* Is it wrong feeding google or facebook so much ""Big Data""
* (bonus question) With increasing efforts from companies to merge all their products under one platform should we allow them the monopolies they are creating and what are upsides and downsides of those (convenience **vs** difficulty to switch to different products).

\**Note that personal data I'm refering to might range from my medical problems, personal pictures, real estate data, finances...* all of which can be used by an alogrithm to create my personal profile

&#x200B;

P.S. Sorry if the post is a one big mess (just like my thoughts right now). You're free to give me feedback on how to style it better.",1546732001

Don't be afraid to cut into it when necessary. 

My program starts with a pre-load cache of a lot of data that the program will normally use, but just in case it uses something not yet loaded, I also wrote a small function that loads the missing data on-demand into the cache. Well everything worked but the program took about 25 seconds to load, which was annoying. I spent the whole day today trying to find clever ways to load the data faster - and came up with a bunch of possible solutions - the fastest of which was loading everything concurrently with threads.

It still was kind of slow. Just at the end of the day the solution came to me - I could delete all the pre-load nonsense and the ""cache on-demand"" will just do the work if and when it's needed. It worked perfectly. The loading time at the start went from 25 seconds to 2 seconds, and everything else was running perfectly (with a tiny lag here and there when data is being loaded for the first time). It only created one small bug that could be fixed by adding one line of code.

Anyway, that's how I spent the whole day programming and ended up just removing lines.",1574554673

782,C59OGOJIHA75F256TR41XNV6F,anarchystar,"$100,000 bounty for software platform that can replace the Bitcoin Foundation",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/25sf4f/100000_bounty_for_software_platform_that_can/,"Hi Everyone,

My name is Olivier Janssens, early adopter and Bitcoin millionaire.  The Bitcoin foundation has had its role in the last 2 years.  Unfortunately, it is internally recreating the same archaic political system that fails to work for society.  Bitcoin is the currency of the internet generation.  It puts the power back into the hands of the people.  You cannot expect its main representative organisation to be exactly the opposite: A non-transparent, political and secretive elite.  We have been trying to push the BF for transparency and clear communication for years, without result.  Meanwhile they started creating even more political structures inside, such as committees, which can only be accessed by knowing the right people.  At the bitcoin 2014 conference, organised by this same organisation, I expected to see full internet participation + live streaming of their events.  Especially of the BF member meeting, where they are supposed to get input from their members and disclose what they have been up to.  Instead, the board decided that the event is not to be recorded or broadcasted.  We have also no idea or say on how our money is spent.  Half of their board gets elected by industry members (a group of about 100 companies), and recently lead to another extremely controversial election of Brock Pierce, which has a history of being connected to cases involving fraud and pedophilia.  This needs to stop.  

We as an internet community, don’t need public figures to decide what’s good for us.  We need to stop politicking and start focussing on the projects directly.  For example, we need a project to fund the core development of bitcoin, and put our money straight to that.  We need a project to have lobbyists in Washington, to fight the anti-bitcoin lobbyists from Mastercard, and to prevent the government from destroying the currency.  Basically, we don’t need another intermediary.  We can do this ourselves.  Therefor, I want to announce today that I am organising a contest and giving $100k USD in BTC, to the group that can come up with the best platform to make this happen.  I am thinking of a system where prominent people can voice their opinion, where people can propose projects, and where the core devs can actively show their roadmap with detailed features + costs, and where we can vote on the features being implemented by sending bitcoins towards the feature of our choice.  This will allow the core dev team to expand by being able to add/pay more devs for feature requests which are fully funded.  Maybe we can even evolve to a system later where anyone can work on a feature, which, when programmed properly (approved by the core team), will receive the bounty.  The same applies to lobbyists, we just send bitcoins towards the one that we consider the most competent for the job.  This will allow Bitcoin to grow and expand at a rate it deserves, a rate that a political organisation such as the foundation can never accomplish.  

Let’s liberate bitcoin.

Olivier

Rules of the contest:

- Anyone can participate
- Software will be open sourced
- I will cover the initial hosting costs, until it can be self funded and created as a DAO
- Reddit community can help by voting on the platform submissions they like the most
- Ultimately I will decide who wins, but I will take all votes and feedback into account
- Deadline for submissions is 1 month from now: 17 june 2014 at 12:00 UTC

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all your great feedback, ideas and private messages.  I will provide an update here very soon.

**UPDATE 2**: Please email your submissions to platformbounty@gmail.com - You can also add me on twitter to follow updates more easily: @olivierjanss  - The deadline of 17th of june still stands, but we do not require a finished product.  The bounty will be given to the team with the best idea/skills to make it happen (partial payments until it is completed).  If you just have an idea, but no programmers, you are still free to submit it.  If it turns out to be the best one, we will help find a team for you.
We understand many of you do not want to make your idea public at this point.  If there are multiple really good submissions we will only put them up to vote after you give permission.  Please note that if people submitted the same idea, we will go with the one who submitted it first.

**UPDATE 3**: The winner has been announced here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29n8o0/100000_bounty_winner_announcement/

So during my summer I really want to crack down on what to do for my final year project! I am aware the university will be sending out some advice in a few weeks but I don't want to wait that long!

It would be cool if someone could help get the ball rolling and recommend some project ideas. 

Also for anyone who has done final year CS projects in the past what do they involve and what are the big mistakes and don'ts I should look out for!

Thanks all, I know I am asking alot but I am just keen to get a foothold before I am back at university in September",1562394771

Welcome to Bitcloud.",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vd2r1/we_want_to_replace_youtube_dropbox_facebook/,"Hello. We are at the very early stages of turning the proof of bandwidth idea into a reality. Please read the [nontechnical white paper](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/Bitcloud%20Nontechnical%20White%20Paper.md) and the [Bitcloud protocol white paper](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/bitcloud.org). We are going public with this idea because we want to be as open and transparent as possible. This project requires a massive amount of thought and development in many different parts of the protocol, so we need as many people helping as possible.  
  
With the proof of bandwidth concept, we can create decentralized applications for sharing bandwidth and routing network traffic. Bitcloud is a [distrubuted autonomous corporation](http://newswax.com/2014/01/implications-crypto-assets-part-3-distributed-autonomous-corporations/), which means nodes have an incentive to come onto the network. One of the many problems of certain free and open source projects in the past has been the lack of a profit incentive. With Bitcloud, nodes on a mesh network can be rewarded financially for routing traffic in a brand new mesh network. This removes the need for Internet Service Providers (Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.). We can also replace many of the centralized applications on the current Internet, such as YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify, and others with decentralized, open source alternatives. We will have to start by decentralizing the current Internet, and then we can create a new Internet to replace it. If you're interested in **privacy, security, ending Internet censorship, decentralizing the Internet, and creating a new mesh network to replace the Internet**, then you should join or support this project.  
  
If you're a developer who sees the potential implications of this project, send an email to developers@bitcloudproject.org.  
If you're someone who wants to help the project in any other way (web design, marketing, graphics design, etc.), send an email to support@bitcloudproject.org.   
We don't think it would be appropriate to take donations at this time, so please hold off on that for now.

Feel free to x-post this to other subreddits if you think those individuals would be interested in helping out with this project. I'll also be glad to answer any questions that people have in this thread. I'm currently working on an FAQ, so your questions will be helpful to the project as a whole.

**UPDATE:** We are getting a lot of emails, so please be patient when it comes to responses. Just to give developers a heads up, there will be a section in the forums on the bitcloud website that divides up everything we need to do. We need need move the server over to the domain (right now it just redirects to the white paper). For now, head over to #bitcloud on freenode IRC and /r/bitcloud for discussions and development.

**UPDATE #3:** Thank you for the wonderful response! I've been answering questions this whole time, so I need to go eat something. Keep posting your questions, and I'll try to get to as many of them as possible. There is also some activity on freenode IRC at #bitcloud and on /r/bitcloud. Be back soon!  
  
**UPDATE #4:** Thanks again everyone. I need to finish setting up the website and forums, so I'll have to leave this thread for now. Anyone who is still interested in the project can head over to /r/bitcloud and follow us on twitter @bitcloudproject. The forums will be up in a day or two, which will be the best platform for planning, discussion, and development. See you there!",1389911743

Did everyone forget what the original plan was?  

Sure the markets are great for media exposure, but wow did things change in the past few years.  Money has converted this movement into a war.  Greed has taken over.  People are more concerned about their coin ""going to the moon"" than helping others.

I’m 33 now. Obviously, it was awhile since my last math class. I tested into Math 70 which is beginning algebra.  For context, my son in 8th grade is studying what I did in my first class.

I’ve taken 8 math classes since I started (we do quarterly years here). There were times I didn’t think I’d make it but I studied a LOT, watched countless YouTube videos, exhausted google, went to tutoring sessions, went to office hours, the list goes on.

Tomorrow, I’m taking my final exam for the last math class required for my degree. I’m more than ready for it.

If you’re interested in CS, don’t let the math discourage you. No one is a natural. Anyone who is good at math worked very hard to learn it, and it may be different for other students, but it actually got easier as I took harder classes. 

So that’s all. If a 30-something high school dropout who had to learn to plot numbers on a graph and how the hell fractions work can do it, you can too.",1544013840

Even though we had different majors, even though we were different races, even though we came from different income levels, we all went to that place to have a better life.

But, I've tinkered with programming (in BASIC, Visual Basic, Perl, now Python) when needed over the years, starting in my teens during the 80's and throughout my career, and had at least entry level courses in COBOL(in about 1990), C, and Java (in about 2009) while getting my degree.  (I was somewhat of a nontraditional student.)

Today I decided that I needed to script something, and hoped that *learning* how to do it in Python was going to take me significantly less time than doing it manually - with the benefit of future timesavings.

No, I didn't go from 0 to production in a day.  But if my coworkers will leave me alone, I *might* be in production by the end of the day tomorrow.

The last thing I used to scratch an itch like this was Perl in about 2013.  Like with Python, I was learning as I went.  And in that case - while some parts weren't bad, other parts were like running barefoot over sharp glass.  I have working Perl from back then that I still don't *quite* understand bits of, because the best I could do is take someone else's example and massage it for my needs in some places.  (In fairness, what I was doing there was a bit more complex, but it still wasn't rocket science.)

What I'm working on today isn't super complex - I'm taking some user input, making some decisions based on that input, reading a .csv, and will ultimately output a json file - but I've been able to easily understand everything I've done so far.  I've done a bit of googling around the json and csv bits, and that seems pretty easy too.  But putting together what I've done so far has just been a complete joy.

The syntax is so wonderful - it took me a couple of minutes to realize, for instance, that there was no ""wend"" or similar for a ""while"" loop, that merely the end of a code block would serve the same purpose.  But when I did I immediately thought ""wow, of course not - how efficient is that?""   I feel like that's a big part of what I'm enjoying - things that maybe should be able to be implied rather than explicitly typed in or stated, actually *are* implied in many cases.  It feels like there's a lot less in the way of required punctuation, that's for sure.

Overall it feels natural, intuitive, and relatively easy to understand and write the code for the basic things I'm doing - I haven't had this much fun doing stuff with code since the days fooling around with BASIC in my teens.

Well, thanks if you actually read this far.  I've just found this to be so fun and exciting I had to share it with folks who might care.  I think I'm going to be looking for excuses to script things with Python going forward.  :-)

A simple guy's app :

    from guy import Guy

        app.run()

A guy's app can be runned in 3 modes :

* can reuse a chrome browser (in app mode), on the host. To keep the minimal footprint. (app mode)
* can embbed its CEF (like electron) (thanks cefpython3), to provide all, to the users. (cef mode)
* can act as a classical web server. Any browser can be a client (server mode)

A guy's app can be released as a simple py3 file, as a freezed exe (pyinstaller compliant), or as an apk (with buildozer/kivy)

Just a post to announce that It's released, under an apache2 licence.

Here is another post bitching about the expensive parking, so disregard if you hate seeing these posts. 
My girlfriend goes to LBSU and I recently found out that she pays roughly $300 a YEAR for parking while we pay $300 a SEMESTER. This completely blew me away considering that LBSU is also a CSU and they don’t have to fight in the hunger games for parking each and everyday as we do. 

Why are we paying twice as much for this horrendous parking situation that is MILES behind LBSU’s? I get we have a parking structure currently paced to finish in the fall of 2020 but even that got delayed by a whole year and prices STILL went up. I seriously believe the school should be transparent as to why parking is so expensive. 
I struggled to pay the permit last semester and this semester I planned on doing the shuttle service for $80 but discovered the shuttle closes at 7pm when my last class is at 8pm. 

I believe the students shouldn’t be pushed around and expected to shell out $300 per semester on a system that is virtually a scam. There are 40,000 students that enrolled at CSUF in 2019. Even if half of those students bought parking, we are looking at the school getting $6,000,000 in return. Where is that money going? Do they seriously need to be THAT expensive?

This might not go anywhere but to my fellow Titans, be aware that the school is clobbering us with this parking permit price.",1579060384

We learned about the basics of protocols and even did some socket programming. But the main issue I'm having is how are these protocols implemented? 

Like, where/what is the code that lets the sender know when to send bits, what to do when ACK received out of order, congestion control, and the such? Where is this code implemented? Is it in a language like C? Assembly? How does one ""edit"" this code (in theory; I'm sure it's very difficult to actually edit the code). 

Is the code for the protocol itself inside our routers? Is it in the computers? I really don't understand. Another question, one of our first assignments was to have a host and client server, and just have the host send the client a message using sockets. At no point in this assignment did I see any TCP implementation other than listening for the host and getting a handshake. In this case, was there TCP inbetween sending the message between host and client?

They also served well to kickstart mooc revolution.

However It's been 8 years since then and I'm yet to see a good full blown course on Compilers, Language Theory (Automata) and Operating System. In my experience, Compilers by Alex Aiken (coursera -> stanford languita -> edx) is the only formidable course on the subject. CS262 by Westley weimer on Udacity was one of my favorites back in 2012, but it's shallow and introductory. I don't know why this is so. Even the compiler course (By Aiken) hasn't aged well. The toolkit for programming assignment (which is 80% of learning) is outdated and very difficult to work with.

There's a similar argument for Automata  and Operating Systems. There is a course by Ullman on Automata but it's not very comprehensible (no offense to Sir Ullman). Similarly, there are a few courses on OS on Udacity, but they aren't very comprehensive either.

In my experience, MIT has some of the best, most informative and comprehensive CS courses (on edX). Most of these courses have a detailed lab component and aren't water downed like others. We need a few such courses on the subjects like OS, Compilers and Language Theory. Courses with in-depth but easy to setup programming challenges that span for at least 10 weeks and cover the topic comprehensively.",1587443209

&#x200B;

Hello everyone. This post is to elaborate on why our Computer Science Department is poorly constructed and why professors such as William McCarthy DESERVES to be fired. Aside from the numerous of negative post you will see just by simply typing his name with CSUF, I will be putting in my perspective about my experience with this ""person"". I will not be referring to him as a professor because simply put, he's not.

&#x200B;

My first encounter with William McCarthy began when I was enrolled in CPSC 301, a requirement class that every computer science student has to take in order to be approved for several upper division classes. For those who have never taken CPSC 301 yet, the first two weeks we are required to take an exam where it tests our programming skills to present date(Stuff from 120,121,131).  Our primary compiler used is called Visual Studio and that was what was on the computers that we needed to take the exam on. I took the exam just like everyone else and at the beginning of the 2nd week, McCarthy told us who failed and who passed. I unfortunately was on the list that did not pass. After class, I went up to him to discuss what was the mistake that I made, since I was heavily surprised that I had failed. I had taken the mid-EPP prep exam and scored reasonably high and even went to the workshop. He sat me down and showed me the mistake. **He used his own personal compiler to compile.** His own personally compiler detected a coding error that I had made, where if the code miraculously managed to escape without first going through my else(final case) statement, then the code returns nothing. This being a final case statement, means if everything fails, then the final case statement will be activated and run the code inside of there. This code statement is proper and did work on Visual Studio. No errors, ran multiple instances, all returning a valid input. But because **HE USED HIS OWN COMPILER** he decided to mark me as doing it improper. I felt that the situation was extremely improper because we were given the compiler to take our exam on, so why is he grading our project on his own compiler? I went to a professor that I was currently enrolled in and explained to him my situation and he ran my code via Visual Studio and saw that every case passes and that I should have received a 100%. Puzzled as well, he went to the department chair and informed them about the matter and managed to convince McCarthy to regrade all our exams using the School Provided Compiler. I was lucky enough to get out of the class because from my fellow classmates who were stuck and enrolled told me only the horrible things he said. He criticized the students for not reading x y z books and how that why they're horrible programmers. He critiqued about why students only know C++ and not know other languages despite C++ is what is taught as our primary language. Just... a horrible first experienced

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, I have him for 2 classes. My AI(artificial intelligence class) and my Game Development Class(Game Dev). For our AI class, he doesn't try to teach by the book and does it his way, which is extremely difficult for an introduction class. Like, we've been spending 13 weeks creating a bot that can train itself to play a specific game and at the end, only 1 group legitimately has it working and they had to help everyone. We sent him numerous of emails and went to his office hours and he would either curve the subject or give us such a shitty answer, that it doesn't even help. I've contacted the department chair about it and told him our entire situation and guess what he does. After that meeting, he was apparently suppose to go to our class and talk with us and the professor. Never showed up. For thanksgiving, we were suppose to play against each other's bot to see which is the strongest. Waste of fucken time. We all did that, and in lecture today, he wanted to do a fucken round robin. (so top 8 plays against each other so we get a top 4, then a top 2, and then we get our 'best bot'"". We have all played against each other during break, so we all knew who was at the top and whom were at the bottom, but he was so heavily insistent that we do the round robin that he wanted the top 8 teams to play against each other. Finding the class to be a waste of time, a majority of students had already left the class, some being part of the top 8. This annoyed McCarthy and what he did was he went to check on the remaining teams to see if they were still here. The few that was, he wanted them to play against each other. One of the teams, unfortunately did not bring his laptop to class because there was no mentioning of doing a round robin. McCarthy decided to lecture the student on why wouldn't he bring his laptop and on why didn't he have his bot running 24/7.

\-deleted image as per request of the student-

Just to mention, **the 24/7 service that they wanted us to use is a PAID SERVICE, where we would PAY to keep our bot running.** The department mentioned how they'd reimburse us if we have to spend money, but never mentioned an amount. Sad to even say that the department wants us to pay for our grade? To add salt to our wounds, we also have to do a capstone project and still have our final exam in additional to said bot, because why not?

&#x200B;

\-pending verification from the student of i may use their quote- A student mentioned out that mid-class, McCarthy talked about how CSUF students are lazy and how the school is horrible

Given our horrible situation, I decided to go and talk with our department chair and his response was

[https://imgur.com/mGNNA20](https://imgur.com/mGNNA20)  Department Chair Response

Horrible response. ""Your professor isn't doing anything and you guys are suffering? Have you tried talking to him?"" Frustrated, I went even further into the school system and went and talked with the Dean of Students. I will not be posting their response since that seemed a little more private, but it went along the lines of ""We are sad to hear this but we can't do anything. Please try to discuss this with your Department Chair"". ... Great School. Also to mention, **the Computer Science Department Chair has even been avoiding reply to our Professor's Email for the last week**, since before thanksgiving. 3 Days into the week, he still hasn't returned to his office. ""Quoted from McCarthy himself"".

&#x200B;

I'll fill in details about my experience in his game development class but shorten down, haven't learned anything, gave us 2 weeks to make an 8 level super mario game, giving us 2 weeks to make a Crossy-Road game in UNREAL ENGINE without any tutorial or help because **""There are too many Crossy-Road tutorials in Unity. Let's do Unreal""!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What I want to get out of this post is, as students, we shouldn't have to be dealing with this horrendous situation. Why am I paying money for an education where I spend more time googling up information than lecture. Why am I paying money for professors who doesn't want to teach? Why am I spending hours and hours driving to a class where I am not even learning?

If I can say one thing that I really learned from all my years at being in CSUF is that.

""The hardest part of CSUF is finding a good professor and not the course itself.""

&#x200B;

I've honestly put in as much effort as I could in trying to deal with the situation. I have contacted the dean, the department chair, the professor and sadly been brushed away by all of them. I hope this could shine some light for those of you who want to come to CSUF, especially if you want to be a Computer Science Major.

&#x200B;

12/10/19: I have received news that classes are now revealing the professors teaching the courses and it has come to my attention that McCarthy is still teaching several courses next semester. I find that very unacceptable given all the details and cases we have.

 [http://chng.it/KkxZVK7jfv](http://chng.it/KkxZVK7jfv) I highly recommend that if you want the situation to be looked at, then to sign the petition and bring attention to this matter and get the campus involved. 

\*If you have anything you would like to add to the post anonymously, feel free to message me on discord as  **throw\_away#1249**  or directly message me here on reddit and I will include it to the post. I will make sure your name is taken out. This post is meant to keep the school and department in check. If the department and professors are performing poorly and affecting the overall school atmosphere and credibility, wouldn't it be in our best interests to improve our situation? If bodies of students are having issues with a professor for a multiple of semesters, shouldn't that be something to be looked into and not brushed away? If everyone is just content with the situation at hand, then nothing will need to be done and this post can be ignored.

But i'm skeptical about a CS degree. In your opinion do you think that being good in math is a crucial part in being a successful Comp Sci Student? I'm a programming hobbyist and I've been working on a small scale Android game for the past few months. I've taken a real enjoyment to coding and programming. I'm wanting to further my education in computer programming and potentially get a job in the video game industry as an entry level programmer upon finishing my degree. Through all the research I've done I've come to find that most Programmers for mid-level and AAA companies started there journey with a Comp Sci degree. I've always had an aptitude for computers but Math never was my strong suit. I was pretty much a D and C student in all my math classes throughout high school. I know that when it comes to coding and programming specifically that math is not a super huge part but I like the idea of the broad spectrum of jobs that comes with a Comp Sci degree. Most of the prereqs for a Comp Sci degree consist of Calculus, and Physics. I am passionate about becoming a game developer but I am also weary that I may be in over my head pursuing a Comp Sci degree when my skills in math are sub-par.

Brunette female late 20s/early 30s hooks you in before Tall average build dude with black hair and goatee comes in to act like ""nah we shouldn't get them involved (/scammed)."" They target young couples that seem nice enough to engage coversation with but then just won't leave and hold you hostage in coversation before talking about how they want to let you in on their mentor who retired all young and rich. But then they talk about ""possibly"" setting up a coffee meeting and ask for your phone number but get shady when you ask them for more info or refuse. I even tried offering my (spam) email but they're like ""oh he doesn't have email."" Got to be phone(?!). Dafuq bitch it's 2018 my grandma has an email and there are even dogs that have their own IG but somehow your rich ass friend doesn't do email for business communications. 



My girl and I were approached by them at Target on Yorba Linda Blvd by school last year (2017) and caught onto their shit quick. But today at Costco (Fullerton, closest to school) we overheard and witnessed the same couple giving the same schpiel to another unsuspecting couple. We stalked them for a bit to confirm and after they finished their final shady sales pitch, my girlfriend and I approached the unsuspecting couple and asked if that couple mentioned a mentor who can get you rich too. They confirmed and we told them what we knew. Went to Costco's staff to end this shit. We looked for them and what do you fucking know they're back at it again with another couple smh


TL;DR creepy couple harassing other young couples shopping about some rich and young mentor but just want your number and hook you into Amway's MLM (multi-level-marketing), get-rich-quick pyramid scheme. Don't let them steal your time because that bitch will talk for days",1522931092

I cannot seem to suggest good/any algorithms for problems that come up in my class or in chapter 1 of my professor's textbook. I'm definitely lacking something, but can someone provide me with a good source so that I can get around that? The textbook I've been using (that isn't my professor's) is _Introduction to Algoritms_ by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. I've read through only the first ~110 pages, but I feel like it just teaches how to solve stuff optimally rather than how to try and fit something to an arbitrary runtime.

I'll provide a couple of examples regarding stuff that I don't even know how to approach. I'm not asking for solutions for these, but just sources that I can look at to tell me how to start dissecting these on my own:

1) We're in a building _n_ floors tall, and we have _k_ students. We want to find the lowest floor such that if a student jumps off then they die. The only way to test this is to have a student jump off. If student _i_ jumps and lives, student _i_ is the next to jump; if not, then student _i+1_ is up next. Assuming that _k < ceil(log_2 n)_, **propose an algorithm that runs in O(k + n / 2^(k-1)) time**.

2) For any string S containing only 0's and 1's, a string is _balanced_ if the number of 0's equals the number of 1's. Propose an algorithm to find the maximum balanced sub-string in **a) O(n^2) time, b) in O(n) time.**

Thank you very much. I hope to get better, as I'm struggling in all of my classes. I'll probably be posting on here often, unless if this isn't the right sub for this.

Let me give you a helpful hint..

We're not in a correction until the sweat falling down your neck meets the sweat of your ass crack in a pool on your desk chair while your sitting up at 3am staring at a stamp chart 3 inches from your face trying to convince yourself thats its going to reverse any second now. Your hand shaking like a Parkinson's patient over an oily mouse when suddenly you feel the dire need to take a shit but you vomit in your mouth a little bit instead and before you have time to question how those two bodily functions could possibly be related we've already dropped another 20%.  You've now got a big red dildo candle showing a 60% loss in a matter of minutes staring back at you as price has dipped far below your buy in spot, all the profits you made over the past several weeks, dreams of that new car, that new house disappear in an instant and you cant imagine what possibly could have caused this. 

You default to erroneously blaming the Chinese but that doesn't quite add up so you take to twitter with panicked breath searching for anyone, anything that might have the answer as to what the F is happening.  Of course no one has any more of a clue then you do so you immediately start to internalize the struggle.  What starts as a whisper of ""why didn't I just sell"" turns into a rampage scream in the back of your mind, after all its so obvious that this was the top, it's so clear now looking back, of course that was the top how the hell didn't I see that 15 minutes ago?  Meanwhile we're down another 5% and you just can't take it anymore.  Tears are rushing from your eyes, something that looks like dried blood is all over your arm emanating from the spot you didn't realize you were subconsciously digging your fingernail into.  You close your eyes just for a moment but when they reopen you realize you've somehow already logged into your Coinbase account and punched in a sell order.  Thats it.  You sold.  Your devastated, but manage to breathe a small sigh of relief. Well at least i can't lose anymore you say, at least i walked away with something.  Your emotionally and physically exhausted now but you manage to drag yourself across the room, you fall flat on your bed with one final thought passing through your mind before you let the darkness overtake you...""why didn't i just sell the top?""

In the morning you wake to the realization that you slept fully clothed and at an odd enough angle that your neck is surely going to feel exactly as bad if not worse for the rest of the day.  The events of the previous night come back to you in a flurry of blurred emotions and while you almost can't bring yourself to check the price you just have to know.  How much lower did it go? After all, there is still a glimmer of a hope, you think well, perhaps it isn't all bad, perhaps I can buy back in a bit lower and make the losses back in the long term.  You begrudgingly open a chart and whatever small amount of hope that remained escapes your lungs before the sigh hits your lips.  Price has fully recovered, it's actually trading up 10% from yesterdays highs...

Thats a correction.

## Introduction

JustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming.

Unlike other web frameworks, JustPy has no front-end/back-end distinction. All programming is done on the back-end allowing a simpler, more productive, and more Pythonic web development experience. JustPy removes the front-end/back-end distinction by intercepting the relevant events on the front-end and sending them to the back-end to be processed.

In JustPy, elements on the web page are instances of component classes. A component in JustPy is a Python class that allows you to instantiate reusable custom elements whose functionality and design is encapsulated away from the rest of your code.

Custom components can be created using other components as building blocks. Out of the box, JustPy comes with support for [HTML](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/html_components) and [SVG](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/svg_components) components as well as more complex components such as [charts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction) and [grids](https://justpy.io/#/grids_tutorial/introduction).  It also supports most of the components and the functionality of the [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) library of [Material Design 2.0](https://material.io/) components.

JustPy encourages creating your own components and reusing them in different projects (and, if applicable, sharing these components with others).

JustPy supports visualization using [matplotlib](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/matplotlib) and [Highcharts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction).

JustPy integrates nicely with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and simplifies building web sites based on pandas analysis. JustPy comes with a [pandas extension](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/pandas?id=using-the-pandas-extension) that makes it simple to create interactive charts and grids from pandas data structures.

For updates and news please follow the [JustPy Twitter account](https://twitter.com/justpyframework)

## Hello World!

    import justpy as jp
    
    def hello_world():
        wp = jp.WebPage()
        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')
        wp.add(d)
        return wp
        
    jp.justpy(hello_world)

The program above activates a web server that returns a web page with 'Hello world!' for any request. Locally, you would direct your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) or http://localhost:8000/ or  to see the result.

Here is a slightly modified version in which 'Hello world!' changes to 'I was clicked!' when it is clicked.

    import justpy as jp
    
    def my_click(self, msg):
        self.text = 'I was clicked!'
    
    def hello_world():
        wp = jp.WebPage()
        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')
        d.on('click', my_click)
        wp.add(d)
        return wp
    
    jp.justpy(hello_world)

Many other examples can be found in the [tutorial](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/getting_started)

## Under the Hood

JustPy's backend is built using:

* [starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) \- ""a lightweight [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services"".
* [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) \- ""a lightning-fast [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server, built on [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) and [httptools](https://github.com/MagicStack/httptools)"".

JustPy's frontend (which is transparent to JustPy developers) is built using:

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) \- ""The Progressive JavaScript Framework""

The way JustPy removes the frontend/backend distinction is by intercepting the relevant events on the frontend and sending them to the backend to be processed.

tom is taller than steve

Adam is shorter than Steve

Adam is the same height as Jill only if Adam is shorter than tom.

&#x200B;

True or false: Adam is the same height as Jill.

&#x200B;

This is a really easy puzzle for us humans. We logically look through the statements and can see that Steve must be between tom and Adam, then make the logical leap that Adam is shorter than tom. Then we know that the if statement holds true and that Adam is indeed the same height as Jill.

&#x200B;

Im trying to understand how a computer might solve this OTHER than brute force. My impressions is that languages such as prolog use a combination of backtracking and unification to basically set one variable as something and then try everything else to see if the constraints hold. Then if so, it moves to the next variable until it knows all of them.

&#x200B;

This is just very different from how we ""think"". My impression is that it make it harder for the computer to relate what it needs to sole the problem. Like lets say we removed ""Adam is shorter than Steve"". Then the puzzle becomes unsolvable because we don't have any information really about Adams height. A human can recognize this and say it. But a computer cannot.

&#x200B;

Here is my question: Is there any research into making a computer think like we do - relationally, spatially, so that it can know what it does not know and perform logical reasoning like we do? What should I look up if I want to learn more about this.",1550896170

I am not really sure what the right word is. I had an advisor ask me if I was sure I wanted to pursue a STEM degree because not many women were in STEM degrees.  He suggested I consider the nursing degree.  I was in an Engineering class where another girl and I were the only females in the class, so the professor made us be partners (everyone else got to pick) because ""Women work better together"".  I've had plenty of inappropriate advances. I have had countless situations where I am never asked to pull my weight, like being assigned the smallest or easiest portion of a project, etc etc etc.

The only thing I can think of to do is to keep doing my best.  None of it makes me angry, and normally I just brush it off.  But it can be disheartening sometimes. I very much want to be taken seriously. 

I don't want to sound all social justice warrior here. I actually haven't talked to many other female programmers so I am just wondering...Is this just what the industry is like? Is the workplace any better about valuing people for their skill, rather than some factor like gender or race? ",1519302072

I’m hoping that I could become a full time software engineer, however I feel like there is so much for me to re-learn and get exposed to, before I would consider myself qualified. Not to sell myself short, I do have a more fulfilling resume than many of my peers who are in the same position, however I do not feel that my experiences resonates the duties that Will be required of me as a legitimate full time engineer. To clarify, I’ve currently been an intern for a small startup for 6 months, however I only work 10 hours a week. The quality of work that I was provided with, doesn’t reflect the time I’ve been there. The internship experience has provided me with some exposure to both the backend and front end tasks, however not enough to the point that I would feel confident in my own skills. I’ve performed some research from another company, where I programmed the logic code for a demo peer-peer blockchain network, but that’s all That I was able accomplish, before funding ran out. I am the Vice President of the cyber security club, which had drastically improved my soft skills, but only provided me with some exposure to cyber security, and not something that I would feel confident performing in. I also helped organize and host a hackathon on campus with a group of students.  Lastly, I’ve had some volunteer tutoring experience of a child’s version of an Arduino. The only area in my resume that I seem to be lacking is that I do not have an amazing personal project that I could present, and have to rely on a project that I completed for a homework assignment. My biggest concern is that I know I do terrible in technical-based questions, which I believe is the result of my lack of understanding of basic concepts that I had simply not retained. Despite my exposure towards the entire software development process, I do not think I can program efficiently to save my life. Most of my accomplishments were the result of figuring stuff out using google, rather than my own problem-solving abilities. I am currently taking a data structures course to familiarize myself with older concepts, but I was wondering if there is anything that I should focus on within the next few months to improve myself as a programmer, and a potentially efficient software engineer ?

I learned Python in 1998, and I used it pretty much daily through my working life. Its connectivity with everything has allowed me to do all kinds of interesting and fun things. When I discovered that the [AxiDraw](http://www.axidraw.com/) pen plotter has a [Python binding](https://github.com/inconvergent/axidraw-xy), I decided to try writing in my own handwriting with my own pen. Something I've been unable to do for years.

It has taken a lot, mostly because I can't type, so I've been limited to voice recognition and copy and paste, but the letter linked above is where I got to this evening.

I thought I would share my mini triumph.

I've learned and programmed in a lot of different languages over the years. I have written several languages myself. And even though Python wasn't my first language, it is the first language I consider for any new project. I'd have to have a compelling reason to use something else. So thank you, Python, for making this possible.

</ shameless preaching to the choir> ;)

---

Edit: In the comments a couple of people asked for a video. I will make a proper video with the AxiDraw as soon as I can. [We just did a quick test](https://youtu.be/W5YGwNlO53A) on my wife's Cricut craft cutter. It works there too, though you can't tilt the pen or change the pressure. So apologies it's not the proper plotter, but you can see how the paths are traced on this video.",1491043179

I don't need to take any classes between now and through the end of January 2020.  Before today, I thought I would've received an offer for an internship because it looked like it was a slam dunk: was told personality was perfect fit for position and firm, assessment was near perfect, but ultimately I can devote only 3.5 months full-time, and the project they had in mind would take longer to complete (initial phone interview started in late August).  HR said I'd be a shoe-in for a junior dev position there after graduating if one is available.  

**Current State:** So now I'm wondering what to do next.  Fortunately, I was accepted into a mentor/mentee program that starts tomorrow, so that'll be a great way to get advice, bounce off ideas and network; the mentors are recent graduates who work in the industry and the mentees are STEM students.  My main interest is software development and security.  I have previous work experience in a different field and can easily build rapport with people.  My resume is in a good condition (reviewed by several people and will have mentor review it as well).  Recently I earned the Security+ certification.

**Next steps(?):**

1) Start thesis

2) Keep applying to internships/part-time jobs

3) Side projects - how to choose though?

4) Attend additional classes

\#3 is especially vague.  I don't even know where to start.  I've worked on some toy apps before I started the program in order to learn the basics of programming and front=end, but that's it.  What does Reddit think?",1569893471

I am aware that computer science draws heavily on coding and I would like to know more about possible job opportunities / research opportunities in this career field. I have a little background knowledge of machinery from my previous experiences, which I am hoping will come in handy as I slog my way through the study area. Any advice / help would be appreciated. 

Also, I forgot to mention but I am interested in making games and creating software that helps with engineering analysis (eg. FEA Analysis), although I haven't been directly involved with any of these experiences before (but I would love to). Are there any age restrictions for programming or for someone to qualify as a programmer as such and if so what is your threshold? I am worried that due to my mature age, I might be prevented from working as a programmer after I graduate (I will be almost 30 by the time I graduate). 

Any programmers in Japan? Could you let me know what fields of programming Japanese are mostly interested in and if there are any opportunities for Gaijin? I met this programmer at a recent Japanese language test center (for which I have been studying as a hobby for the last five years) and he seemed interested in moving to the country with his girl friend (nihonjin) after his success with the game he and his studio team had been working on. It's apparently a game with a shark and emphasis on underwater experiences. It seemed much like Subnautica but with a darker twist on it. I haven't played the game personally, only watched Let's play videos on YouTube by a famous Youtuber but it was interesting. 

I have no idea regarding details of what computer science as a field entails. It has only recently come to my attention as I realised that many internships in college and jobs require knowledge of programming and this is actually an employable skillset to have, which is one of the reasons I am considering. (Another reason is that I personally feel interested in learning more about algorithms such as Artifical Intelligence). A potential drawback I see to studying this field is that I won't be able to pursue another opportunity while I study the degree and there will be countervailing costs to it in the end that offset amounts of time and money I spend on studying it. 

Hence, I would be interested to know what kinds of job opportunities are out there for people who study in this area and their experiences in undergrad and workforce. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my question. I look forward to hearing your answers.",1546211064

* Telegram interface: @WillAssistantBot on telegram

**Details**:

A while back, [I posted a video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/47jdxi/my_open_source_python_personal_assistant/) of my personal assistant - W.I.L.L. It was my first major project, and you guys gave me alot of tips and comments on what you liked, how I could improve, and the right way to do some open source stuff that I hadn't previously encountered.

After **a lot** of rewrites, extensive work (by both me, and the W.I.L.L community), I'm happy to present W.I.L.L version 3.0.

**What can W.I.L.L do?**

One of my major goals with W.I.L.L was not only to make a cool concept for a personal assistant, but to make it usable and useful. W.I.L.L. already has a number of useful plugins, and it's super easy to add more. 

**Plugins W.I.L.L already has:**

* News: ex: ""read me the news"" - a summary of the news from a site of your choice, refreshed every twelve hours
* Weather: ex: ""What's the weather like?"" - weather for your location, delivered using PyOwm

* Reminders: ex: ""Remind me in 10 minutes about how awesome W.I.L.L is"" - sets reminders. You can currently be notified via email and socket.io push notifications on the web app, and thanks to the expandable notification framework, it's easy to add new methods of notifying the user.
* **Search**: The crown jewel of the plugins, set to run by default when no other plugin is triggered by the input. Search runs through a chain of different search engines and sites to find the correct answer of a question. It first searches wolframalpha and wikipedia, and if it can't find anything it uses nlp from the newspaper module and bs4 to parse a correct answer from the top google result.

**Just how easy is it to add a plugin?**

    from core.plugin_handler import subscribe
    def run_check(event):
        #Check for a word in the provided spacy nlp object
        return ""example"" in [i.orth_ for i in event[""doc""]]
    
    @subscribe({""name"":""example"", ""check"": run_check})
    def example_plugin(event):
        return {""type"": ""success"", ""text"": ""example"", ""data"":{}}
    

That's it.

**Contact me**
If you have any requests for new plugins, or further comments about W.I.L.L, feel free to email me at will@willbeddow.com or leave an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/ironman5366/W.I.L.L)

W.I.L.L is very much still in development and I could use suggestions and advice

Thanks!

**Edit**: I forgot about the API! W.I.L.L also provides a free JSON API to use it's features, easily allowing new clients to be written for any platform. It's currently lightly documented in the README, with an example in the quickstart. More extensive documentation is coming as soon as I figure out how I want to write it!

I'm currently taking Discrete Math and Data Structures/Algorithms, and I'm struggling to understand the material. Not only that, but I'm also having trouble recreating the logic during exams. I'm starting to feel like I'm just terrible at math and logic. 


I can genuinely say that it is not my effort that's holding me back because I spend an enormous amount of time studying, which is what I think bothers me the most. 


Hopefully there are some of you out there who struggled with certain subjects and were able to overcome that through changing a habit. So I come to you humbled, asking for any and all input. 
How do I approach the subject, how do I absorb the material better, etc.

This is a throwaway account, by the way.

Last semester during finals week I had a bit of a breakdown in my car. I was parked in the Nutwood Structure on the first floor and was full blown sobbing. This was probably around eleven or twelve at night, maybe even one AM. Two or three guys, I can't remember now, came up to me. I opened my door and one of them asked if I was okay, I said no, and he asked me to get out of the car. I was on the phone so I asked the person on the other line if I could call them back before I got out of the car.

The guy asked if he could hug me so I said he could. We hugged, then he asked me if I was upset over a boy. I said ""sort of"", explained it was my ex boyfriend and that we were best friends but had a fight and I didn't know if he'd ever speak to me again. The guy said something like, ""If you aren't sure that he's the one, then he isn't worth getting upset over."" I don't remember exactly what was said, but I do know the words ""the one"" were spoken. I mentioned that I was mentally ill and that it wasn't helping the situation. Around then some girls pulled up in a car and the guy explained that was his ride, then he left.

Basically, I put all of this information in this post in the hopes that this guy is reading it or that maybe someone will read it who knows him. That incident has stuck in my brain ever since it happened and I would love to have the chance to talk to you in person about how much that's meant to me but mostly to thank you properly. I felt like no one was there for me when this happened and the fact that somebody who didn't even know me would stop to make sure I was okay means the world to me. I honestly tear up every time I think of this, and I've thought about it a lot. I was an idiot when this happened (okay, I was just super emotional) and didn't ask for the guy's name, number, or even what year in school he was.

If it helps, I'm a girl, drive a blue Volkswagen Beetle, have short red hair and green eyes, am really short (about 5'1""), and I think I may have been wearing prescription glasses at the time.

ETA: my car is powder blue, not blue. To some people it even looks gray.

This can be thought of as a Bert-based search engine for computer science research papers. 

https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DependableGorgeousEquestrian-mobile.mp4

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/NaturalLanguageRecommendations

Brief summary: We used the Semantic Scholar Corpus and filtered for CS papers. The corpus has data on papers' citation network, so we trained word2vec on those networks. We then used these citation embeddings as a label for the output of Bert, the input being the abstract for that paper. 

This is an inference colab notebook

https://colab.research.google.com/github/Santosh-Gupta/NaturalLanguageRecommendations/blob/master/notebooks/inference/DemoNaturalLanguageRecommendationsCPU_Autofeedback.ipynb#scrollTo=wc3PMILi2LN6

which automatically and anonymously records queries, that we'll just to test future versions of our model against. If you do not want to provide feedback automatically, here's a version where feedback can only be send manually:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/Santosh-Gupta/NaturalLanguageRecommendations/blob/master/notebooks/inference/DemoNaturalLanguageRecommendationsCPU_Manualfeedback.ipynb

We are in the middle of developing much more improved versions of our model; more accurate models which contain more papers (we accidentally filtered a bunch of important CS papers in the first version), but we had to submit our initial project for a Tensorflow Hackathon, so we decided to do an initial pre-release, and use the opportunity to perhaps collect some user data in further qualitative analysis of our models. Here is our hackathon submission:

https://devpost.com/software/naturallanguagerecommendations

----

As a sidequest, we also build a TPU-based vector similarity search library. We are eventually going to be dealing with 9 figures of paper embeddings of size 512 or 256. TPUs have a ton of memory, and are very fast, so it might be helpful when dealing with a ton of vectors.

# About Me

I've worked in Seattle FANG companies most of my software engineering career and in that time I've ran 300+ coding and system design interviews since 2012. As a way to try to make some side income I tried being a mock interviewer with Gainlo for a short while.

---

# My Experience w/ Gainlo

I was an interviewer for this company/guy for a couple of weeks to test the waters, see how it operates, and if it was legitimate. The appeal of Gainlo is supposed to be that your interviewers are FANG engineers and get risk-free feedback. The person/group behind Gainlo, [""Jake""](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-cook-259bab101/), acts as the middle-man and matchmaker for candidates and charges $250+.

There were 4 main problems with this:

1. **Inconsistent/Low quality interviewers:** A friend was quoted $225 for an entry-level interview by Jake. For perspective, I was paid $50/hr after negotiating. I doubt you're going to get a good, verified, professional interviewer if s/he is willing to take that small of a cut.
2. **Questionable authenticity of interviewers:** all it takes for someone to be an interviewer is to send Jake a LinkedIn profile from a convincing e-mail address that matches that person's profile name.
3. **The interviewer's performance doesn't matter:** [Your interviewer can be complete crap and that's your loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7wmp0k/rant_i_feel_pretty_cheated_paying_for_this_mock/) Jake doesn't assess the people he works with. He just wants to pocket his share and get out of the equation. In the link above, that indifferent interviewer still got paid for doing nothing for you.
4. **No professionalism:** In addition to the link above, [there's no refund policy](https://imgur.com/BJe6dHk). Interviewers get paid when he remembers. He's very disorganized, booking me for times that I explicitly said I couldn't do.

They are taking a huge cut for playing matchmaker when people could instead be getting interviews for free or at least get bids on Reddit forums for mock interviews. **Even if you don't use me, I'll be happy if you don't use Gainlo**.

# Are you still doing Mock Interviews in 2020?

**YES! You only have to pay after our session if you found it useful**, otherwise it's **free**^yep. I take on all the risk and your satisfaction is guaranteed. 

Worst case, you invested 1 hour of your time trying something that didn't work out. Best case, you learned how to really nail interviews! My success stories with helping people are listed below, these folks have never worked in FANG before yet landed full-time positions at one or more companies after practicing with me.

While I am happy that people are enjoying Python and would like to share their achievements it would do good to the channel, in my opinion obviously, to moderate the content a bit. Thy only other programming language channel I subscribe to is /r/cpp so I cannot help but compare the two.

I am also aware that there is another channel that is probably more what I want: /r/pythoncoding .However it has only 8k subscribes while this channel has over 300k.

Obviously you could claim that this proves that the content of this channel is much better then /r/pythoncoding .However I think it is mainly because the latter is more obscure. I think it is a common sense to suppose that a programming subreddit of the format /r/<languagename> will always attract more people. I am a good example. It took me quite a while to realise that I am not getting the quality of the content I've expected from /r/Python .

Therefore, am I the only one that thinks that all post that show off someone's cool Python stuff should have their own subreddit and /r/Python should focus more on the news, etc.?

What I did before starting and some tips:
  1) I planned it for a month due to several things. I'm from Venezuela and I have my own company. I live of the money that I make. So I bringed a friend to my company and make him a business partner with the condition that he has to do all the work. This was perfect since I'm doing 8 hours per day of study. 
   2) Another thing that is important and people forget it; a good CHAIR. If you're going to spend 8 hours every day, 4 hours on weekend, a  good chair is an important thing and not just a furniture.
   3) I made a lot of noise of what I was about to do with my friends and family in order to make this challenge a real thing and keep a little of pressure on me.
   4) Economic situation here in my country is ugly, so it's not common to have your own house, even if you have money. So I live with my family and they make a lot of noise, luckily for me, my house is not small and I fixed a room-garage just for studying and work.
  5) I study an intensive week of pre-calculus before starting just to remember some math that I forgot

A little thing about me: I studied Philosophy first and then Economics in college, I never finished none of them. I started my own company and that was my life three years until now. I always hated school and college, but I never hated to learn. So I started to see that I didn't need the traditional educational system to learn. That's when I heard about the MIT CHALLENGE done by Scott H Young. Inspired by him, I made my own curriculum and my own structure on how to accomplish this, I'm going to write later some rules that I made for this.

   Two days ago I started with my first subject, Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python. I'm going to test if it's possible to finish this first subject within the time that should be done and if I can keep with the hours per day. I'm starting to see that the feedback when you're doing programming problems would be nice with another students.

Note: I want to add that my native language is NOT english, so there are things that are a little harder for me to understand while studying than to a native english speaker.

Note 2: I want to clarify that many of the subjects are electives that you can choose. 

EDIT 16/04/2017: Everyone who joins to the slack team are encourage to look first the two posts, ""Team Community Rules"" and ""General things about this team and the Challenge"" in the channel #general_rules, then you can proceed to start in the #how_to_start channel",1492303602

Because the rules of the Bitcoin protocol prohibit spending coinbase txn with under 100 confirmations this transaction is currently invalid and will remain invalid for another 38 blocks.

I’m taking algorithm analysis at the graduate level and am looking for some resources that help make algorithmic thinking more intuitive. Also looking for some kind of big book of pseudocode. 

I’m still pretty new to CS so I’m trying to get as much practice and experience as possible. Looking for examples that I can refer to so I build good habits from the get go.

I'm good at the math but I fail to understand how it will help me or how it works with programming.

Carol here. I’ve been a mod here for about three months now. Seeing this community grow and thrive within the last year has been awesome, we’re now at almost 7k members! 

That being said, the mod team and I know we can always improve. We want to best utilize this space to better serve you guys, and so we’re currently having discussions about ways to accomplish that. 

We would really appreciate any input you guys have about how to implement changes or tweaks that would help this community out. 

For example, something that’s currently up for debate among us that I brought up would filtering out excessive posts regarding surveys. I’ve noticed they hardly get much attention and are usually scrolled over. I might feel a certain way about them, but what do you guys think?  In addition to this, another moderator proposed updating the side bar. Pursuing this even further, another member of our team suggested adding rules against doxxing, threats of violence, and privacy violations of other student's information.

Is there something you wish were handled better? Any recommendation at all?

I went ahead and asked a few of the other mods if having a singular post dedicated to this topic would be alright, since I really want to open up the channels of communication between us all, to increase transparency and your voice in this sub’s development. 

We ultimately came to the consensus that it was a good idea, please feel free to sound off bellow, your opinion would be greatly appreciated. 

The rest of the mod team and I look forward to incorporating your perspectives into any future decisions that we make regarding the sub’s future. 

All opinions and criticism of our performance so far are welcome so long as they are expressed in a respectful, mature, and constructive manner. Please keep in mind that most of us on this team are students in fairly competitive majors, and are doing this willingly and voluntarily with no compensation except your satisfaction. 

PS- If you don’t feel comfortable sharing your opinion on such a public forum, feel free to PM me or message modmail directly. I want to make sure you have your voice heard as well, and that nothing impedes you from coming forward.

Have a great rest of your night,

The first semester I stayed on top of the reading and started out great. By the second semester I started to become more and more confused. I am currently completely lost. I can keep up during lectures and I follow along perfectly but as soon as it’s time to do a lab I have no idea what to do.  I keep going back and forth on whether or not I want to change majors. Part of me wants to get out this way I have more time for a social life and less stress but the other part of me wants to continue because I really feel like this is something I could love to do. I was wondering if anyone experienced something similar and if it gets a bit better the longer you stick with it. I heard the first three semesters they try to weed people out so I was hoping I could get advice on here.,1537789483

It will use text, video, and interactive randomly generated exercises. So there will be video of me explaining and solving problems, with accompanying text in the web page. Then there will be a place to click for an automatically, randomly generated exercise. You can click to get as many as you want.


I know basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of compliers and interpreters. I think with a medium amount of struggle I can build a JS parser to build and read expressions.


The material will span algebra, geometry, calculus, discrete math, physics, etc. Lots of different kinds of rendering is needed. Ultimately this will expand to very advanced subjects like measure theory and quantum mechanics. So you can imagine what goes into automatically and randomly generating both algebra expressions and geometry diagrams, and then more. It's going to have to use something like LaTeX, Geogebra, maybe both, maybe something else.


I've been handling the text with MathJax, but that can't do geometry diagrams. I could generate the diagrams in a separate software, but then that can't be embedded in the page so the user can generate them on-demand. I started looking at LaTeX.js but the diagrams don't render as expected and there's minimal documentation of this. The code is open source but I'm not proficient enough to be able to understand it. 


Now I'm willing to spend years studying CS to figure this out. In fact I'm currently studying computer architecture and will soon study operating systems and network science. So it's no problem for me to devote a lot of time seriously and methodically learning what I need in order to do this project. I just don't know what I need to learn. … Browsers? JavaScript graphics or animation? What topic or book, or whatever, should I be learning? If no tool exists that can do what I need, what do I need to learn in order to build my own? I'd appreciate anyone just pointing me in the right direction.


Thanks for any help!

[(EDIT: The HTML book is free online, but you can get the PDF/Kindle ebook of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python in this week's Humble Bundle in support of cornavirus relief (Direct Relief, International Rescue Committee, Doctors Without Borders, Partners In Health)](https://www.humblebundle.com/conquer-covid19-bundle)

You can also click this link or manually enter the code: APR2020FREE (on Saturday the code changes to APR2020FREE2)

https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=APR2020FREE

This promo code works until April 7th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes 30 minutes or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.

You can also purchase the course at a discount using my code APR2020 or MAY2020 (or whatever month/year it is) or clicking https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code. I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $14 to $16. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, which means I don't get the credit for referral signups. Blerg.)

Frequently Asked Questions:

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.",1585800794

Direct link to release with downloadables: [https://github.com/Nick-Gottschlich/Social-Amnesia/releases/tag/v1.1.0](https://github.com/Nick-Gottschlich/Social-Amnesia/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

# What's new?

\- Social Amnesia now works fully with reddit and twitter 2FA/MFA (2 Factor Authorization/Multi Factor Authorization). If you have MFA set up you will be taken to a sign on page for reddit to allow Social Amnesia to work properly without having to send a new token every hour. Twitter will have the same login process whether you have MFA set up or not.

\- I've added information text to the login page of the app so that people will know what the limitations of the API are for reddit and twitter.

# What is this?

I’m excited to release 1.0.0 of my side project, Social Amnesia! This completely free and open source software allows you to wipe out old reddit and twitter posts, comments, tweets, and favorites, automatically and on a schedule. It also allows you to configure certain items to be saved based on configuration options like number of upvotes, favorites, or retweets, whether an item has been gilded, how old an item is, or by specifically whitelisting items you would like to have saved.

# Who is this for?

You may be wary of what you post on reddit, twitter, facebook (if you even have one), etc. However, I can imagine many of your friends and family are not. At the end of the day, the safest you can possibly be is to not use any social media. But I think the war on drugs and abstinence-based sex-ed proves everything we need to know about telling people to ""just say no"". What I believe we should be doing is working towards solutions that help reduce the damage that destructive activities can cause. This is why I've built Social Amnesia, which lets you keep your social media history clean with just a few button clicks, and set it up to automatically clean proactively (instead of reactively, after something bad happens to you).

&#x200B;

Most of the tools out that allow you to manage reddit and twitter history are either very user unfriendly (require you to operate command lines and work with scary configuration text files) or cost money. I wanted to develop one that had a convenient user interface and was built to be completely open source so it could be checked to be sure it had no nefarious purposes. I believe the free aspect also helps get people to actually try and use it.

# Why would you need this?

If you've been following the news recently you've probably seen cases of celebrities losing out on big career opportunities because of tweets or other internet posts from their past coming back to haunt them. [Kevin Hart and The Oscars](https://variety.com/2018/film/awards/kevin-hart-says-the-film-academy-has-given-him-an-ultimatum-apologize-or-well-find-another-oscars-host-1203083698/) and [James Gunn and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-exits-guardians-galaxy-vol-3-1128786) are two of the more high profile examples of this recently. Make no mistake, this could happen to anyone, not just high profile individuals. If you are going to tweet, cleaning up your old tweets is one of the best ways to keep a nightmare like this from ruining a potential job opportunity or relationship. Since twitter is mainly focused on current events, and as far as I can tell it's rare for people to look far back in someone's twitter history, this shouldn't effect your day to day interaction with twitter.

On the reddit side of things, many people maintain pseudonymous accounts to post in places like /r/sex, /r/politics or /r/trees. The more reddit history you have, the higher chance you have of being doxxed by someone who might comb through your posts to try and scrape together details to de-cloak you and reveal your real identity. Keeping your reddit history clean is a good deterrent from being doxxed.

# Concerns

I've received concerns about this software when I've posted it before. I'll try my best to detail some of my arguments here, but please leave a comment if you have anything to share and I'll do my best to respond to you.

One of the main concerns I've heard is from people who've gone back to an old reddit post and there have been deleted comments that might have been useful for them ([semi-relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/979/)). I hear you, and to try and combat this I've added some features to this software. The first is a whitelist window, which as far as I know is the only of it's kind in free management software for reddit. Opening this window shows you all of your comments or posts and let's you pick ones to save from deletion. Additionally, when you do go to delete anything, the software will show you every item that will be deleted and ask you to confirm your decision. This software doesn't do anything that isn't possible for a user to do by simply going back through their comments and deleting them.

I realize this isn't a complete solution, so I'd recommend using this software only if you use your reddit or twitter accounts for more current events or sensitive topics. If you provide helpful advice online and want to make sure it's preserved, *be careful using this*.

The second concern I've heard is related to backups, archives and having a false sense of privacy around using this software. Obviously I can't delete anything from reddit or twitter's internal servers, and I can't remove something if it's archived somewhere else. And I'm also limited by their APIs (which I've detailed [here](https://github.com/Nick-Gottschlich/Social-Amnesia#limitations)). However I've done some research, and backups of reddit and twitter are sparse, incomplete, and often hard to find and access. For a while the library of congress was archiving every tweet out there, but they gave up when that became too difficult a task due to the sheer size of twitter. Unless someone is actively archiving your posts, there is a good chance that deleting a tweet or reddit item will actually remove them from the internet.

I dont apologize for anything as this is reality.)

Edit 2: will be away for a bit bit will return to answer questions later. TLDR: To me, CS is a beautiful art. The blend of CS and Math and other disciplines makes it imo one of the best skillset to have! I hate seeing the new javashit.js bloated pushed around so much and not enough promo is being made for CS. Keep CS beautiful!

PLEASE DO YOUR MATH AND STATS! This is the best advice i can give anyone out there! I see many questions on here about how relevant is calculus and linear algebra in the workplace. Let me answer that with a simple statement: You can work for me or you can work with me.

Ive hired quite a few people that went to some school for Web Programming/Angular.js/blablabla framework bootcamp/shortcourse and yes ive hired them for the going rate of what a web developer but the problem is they remain right there, with no chance of moving up. Ive heard all the complaints about ""Not progressing, not going up, not being given enough opportunities to do more serious stuff..."" All they end up doing is converting excel spreadsheets into databases and make front end forms to fill the data.

CS is definitely not programming - get that out of your head! At some point, every business/workplace has some challenges that need those special CS skills to solve. And people with CS are very hard to find usually only 2-3&#37; of the resumes i go through have proper CS in them.

At my previous job I was work in metal mining and I had hired a CS kid for his co-op term and he didnt even know half of the programming languages out there but he said he was OK with Python. What was really impressive was his background in computer vision, algorithms, linear algebra, calculus etc. We had to de-water a lake up north in the north west territories and we had to estimate the number of fish in that lake that would be afected to report back to the RCMP, the local government, fisheries etc.

We brought in ""experts"" and nobody seemed to offer a good solution. This kid and I were going to work together on this project. You can imagine the massive backlash from our web developers. They tore me a new asshole, they brought the fury of the god of war on me. But my superiors knew the reason i chose this kid over our existing developers - they did not have the skills needed for this task and we are not a college that can teach them these skills. We tried to explain to them that they need a different set of skills for different tasks, we've even offered them paid training on some topics to get them started however they declined because of the math prep work needed. Unfortunately you need that 4 years of college education for that and we as a company cannot do such a thing. So naturally the developers hated him, excluded him out of their inner circle, would crack jokes at how he didnt know MVC and made fun of him when he was using python.

So we developed an underwater camera system using a few cameras placed in some spots in the lake. Kid wrote an algorithm that could identify fish in the video frames and he used his statistical knowledge and gave us a good solution on how to estimate the population of fish in that lake. We then spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to catch each fish and tag them so they could be transferred to another lake. His estimate was about 94&#37; of the total fish we caught, a very impressive number! After that, all the other developers calmed their rage and they knew there was a clear distinction between them and this kid. This kid didnt know shit about MVC or angular or node and shit but he had what we really needed for us to get our environment permitting completed!

We worked on a few other interesting math-inspired projects until he got caught up by some oil company who was really impressed with the work he did for us and their office was close to where his parents lived so he relocated to the US.

So please, do your math! Ive been through calc and i hated it, but i pressed my nose and just went for it. I even went for the full specialist option in CS, it sucked balls, my life was spent in books and tears. I didnt really know what I was going to do in life and where I was going with all this math but I am so glad i did it even though i didnt get all A's in them lol. It does really pay off especially statistics which will open up a huge array of opportunities. Take up every opportunity you can: teachers office hours, TAs, workshops and anything you can. Math is not hard, youre just doing it wrong. People who are good in math are good at it because they figured out how to elarn math. Take the time and figure that out. My reason was simply i was overthingking math and that was making me panic often. Do it, because that math and stats skill will make you shine exponentially brighter during interviews! Ive known people at other companies offer a bonus cheque and RSU options if their CS candidate would take the offer.

\###Do not underestimate CS!

Couple of other things i see on here and I can help answer:

\##Do grades and GPA matter?

No not really, unless we have doubts during the interview then we would want to see how you perform academically maybe youre just the type of person shy in interviews but when left alone you can do the job or at least be able to do the research needed to get the job done. However some companies put in a minimum GPA which i think is stupid as it shows they dont really know what they are hiring so they use the GPA system as an indicator when hiring people - watch out for these companies! Unless they are intern/co-op positions which will use GPA as method of filtering out thousands of applications.

\##What programming languages to learn?

Shouldnt matter. The programming language used varies from company to company and if you are real CS, you shouldnt worry about that because the monkey coding is usually offshored or sent to contractors/consulting companies. We want to hire you to solve our problems and usually that just requires paper and you can prorotype in python or anyting and nobody would care.

\##Unix or windows?

Again for a CS position we dont care. Leave that to the monkey coders to figure out

\##How much math do you use everyday?

Quite a bit! I recently developed an algorithm that categorizes hazard and risk levels of contaminants (Arsenic, Asbestos, Beryllium etc) for underground workers in mines/excavation sites/drill rigs etc and it is almost purely based on statistics. That lower and upper confidence limits and the markov model do come in very handy!

\##Do you use proofs at work?

This is going to be probably one of the biggest points ive ever made. I hated proofs, i hated proving that fucking epsilon lies between whatever... I hated induction.. HOWEVER when i was first hired for my previous job as a CS kid, i had immediate and fierce reception from older self taught employees who have been ""programming"" for 10 years in their basements and were eyeing my position. I didnt understand until years later. Whenever i would create something, a simple algorithm for something, they would attack it and say they can do better or faster. This is where your proofs come in and you can also prove that their solution is faulty. This is where runtime algorithms and other proofing techniques (fucking induction) come in useful - you can PROVE that your solution works and if theirs is better, then they have to prove it using the same notation and technique - because this is what is required when you write published papers. The moment they see the Big-O notation is the moment they will scurry away and say ""sorry were too busy, go ahead with your project""

Because that proof is your defence and your CS degree is the biggest supporter of your claim. That is the fastest way to make your boss feel safe in hiring you for the job. Your boss might not (and shouldnt necessarily) know shit about CS but with that proof document, they can use that to defend you and use that for auditing purposes etc.

\##Can i use university lectures from course era and other online resources?

Yes by all means do it. You can even get certifications for these online courses and they are definitely better than those angular bootcamps. If i asked you to explain the normal distribution and how it can be used, then we're talking!

\##Do i need the certifications from these online courses?

Yes. Let me explain why, if I were to give you a task that would affect the health and safety of people, environment etc, then you need to have that certification because if my ass gets audited one day, that cert will show that you are certified by an issuing authority (the college) that you know this field and you know what you are doing.

The reason why I am posting this is because I applied the previous year, with less experience and worse grades and I managed to score a technical interview, which I then didn't get past.

I apply again this year, with one internship under my belt from another company and a better GPA, but this time I didn't even qualify for a technical interview?

I am not sure the reasoning behind this as I am now in my final year of university (which is a preference for this program), I have more experience, a better constructed CV and better grades. I'm not sure if Amazon does a darts approach to selecting applicants, but I just don't understand how I don't even qualify for the technical round.

I'm not trying to bitch or complain that I didn't get in, it's just that I am far more qualified and arguably a better candidate than I was the first time round yet I don't even get a chance to prove myself AND I applied early.

If anyone has experienced this, is there a reasoning behind this? I don't think this has to do with Covid-19, since they did not explicitly state this in their email (plus why would they even advertise the position).

It's frustrating because I've worked hard to to get an internship at Amazon, yet my friend just applied willy nilly and passed all the interviews last year and scored an internship, when I know he isn't as qualified as I am now.",1587407522

Also, one of mine",Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8wc2vi/5_rarely_mentioned_but_super_useful_packages_you/,"I feel like there are a lot of packages out there that are incredibly useful, but often get overlooked for one reason or another. It seems like people spend a lot of time re-implementing something that's already been done pretty well, and that's too bad. Because, using a nice package with a slick api is like taking a breath of crisp morning mountain air.

So here's some packages I love that I think folks should know about and take a look for themselves:

[Inflection](http://inflection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Inflection is ridiculously useful. It has all kinds of tools for altering strings into different formats. Think, conversion from CamelCase to snake\_case. Or, even ordinalizing numbers (1 -> 'first'). Pluralization is in there too. It's really handy with lots of features. I've used it for a few years now without any problems and a whole lot of fresh air in my life.

[Pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/): Python's datetime library is....well, painful to use. It has most everything you need, but doing what you want might be a whole afternoon of consternation. I used a few date/time libraries before I stumbled onto Pendulum. This library is really great. Not only does it offer a great parser that you rarely have to provide anything more than a string representation of a datetime, but it has lots of really useful utilities for working with dates and times (and both). Finally, the best part is that it's a \_drop-in\_ replacement! In fact, Pendulum DateTime objects inherit from python's native DateTime, so you can almost always use them anywhere you would use normal DateTime. This one has been a favorite for a long time.

[pprintpp](https://github.com/wolever/pprintpp): Python's native pretty-printer often renders stuff that's...well, not pretty at all. I often deal with a lot of deeply nested native data-structures (basically JSON rendered into python), and when I'm debugging python's pretty-printer feels pretty stuffy. Enter pprintpp. It's a drop-in replacement that can monkey-patch the built-in pprint function. At any rate, my deeply-nested dicts are formatted with a whole lot more readability in my logs with this package

[Snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/): Profiling performance becomes a pretty necessary task in most python projects with any degree of longevity. However, exploring profile dumps can be a super stuffy experience a lot of times. I've suffered through enough non-intuitive files and interfaces trying to dig down to the cause of slowness in my lifetime. Then, I found Snakeviz. It provides a really intuitive, interactive, in-browser way to explore profiling information. This tool has actually made profiling fun and exciting, and I can't recommend it enough.

[Livereload](https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload): Suppose you're doing something like, say, working on your project's documentation. It's really not fun to, after each tweak of your config or doc files, have to manually run the sphinx-build commands and then open the produced html in a browser. Instead, you might try Livereload. You provide a list of files to watch, run it, and open a browser. Then, any time you change the file, your page will automatically reload. It's a core element of one of my personal projects (sphinx-view...and this doesn't count as my plug), and without it things would be a lot more painful. It can also be used for any number of other situations where html is produced from source files. It's pretty easy to use, too, and soo crisp and cool when you see it in action.

Finally...my plug:

[py-buzz](https://github.com/dusktreader/py-buzz): ""That's not flying, it's falling with style."" Honestly...I have way too much fun with the name. The whole point of this package is that I found myself re-writing the same pattern over and over with custom exceptions. Typically, when I'm writing a new library, I end up with a custom exception base-class that I use (along with derived exceptions) throughout the project. Then, I end up doing the same thing over and over. Well, I took that irritation and turned it into a tool. The handiest parts of this package is the \`Buzz.require\_condition\` function that acts like an assert that isn't disabled in production and \`Buzz.handle\_errors\` which gives you a context manager to handle exceptions within a block. I dog-food the hell out of this package, so it should be in great working order. There's other neat features, but I'll let you read up yourself, if you're interested.

If not, please enjoy learning about the other 5 packages above.

And, please remember, if you find yourself dealing with something annoying: Stop. Google the problem. Find a package that already does it. Install that. Breathe the fresh mountain air.",1530838739

Basically, we had a bunch of gift cards that were supposed to be for employee giveaways, but they were all about to expire. We had about 100 of them.  These gift cards were only redeemable as a guest user so we couldn't just log in to the website and load them all into one user.  We had to perform a separate order for every single gift card.  The worst part is none of the form data was saving in my browser either, so I had to fill in the shipping information manually.  The whole order process took 5 minutes per card.  If done manually, that is..

&#x200B;

I've never used selenium before but I figured this was literally the perfect task, since the orders were all the same save for the gift card codes.  I told my coworker to just help me type out all the codes into a text file and told him I would take it from there.  20 minutes later I had written up a selenium script that ran through the list of codes and performed the orders.  I let the script run for about 15 minutes and we were done!

Trying to understand this method, and its magical constant, was sort of my white whale. It wasn't until 2014, right after I graduated from college, that I finally understood how the method came about. It's actually deceptively simple, and I think that anyone, with a bit of luck, could have come up with this constant.

In fact, you could even create up constants for the sqrt, inverse cube root, and any rational or irrational powers. You can also use a similar technique to create approximations of exp, log, and geometric means.

The fast inverse sqrt method is essentially this approximation:


    float invsqrt(float y) {
      int i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
      i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? 
      return * ( float * ) &i;
    }


in essence, it seems like if you take the bitwise IEEE 754 representation of the float y, as a 32bit integer, divide it by 2 (the left shift by 1), then subtract it from 0x5f3759df, and finally treat it as a float again, then you somehow get a value that seems to approximate 1/sqrt(y), with up to 10% relative error for the range of floating point numbers.

Why?

To answer this question, let's start with some simpler notations. We'll use the function float2int(y) to denote the conversion that takes in a IEEE 754 floating point number, and outputs its machine representation as a 32bit int; basically what the first line does. We'll also define the inverse function int2float(i) that performs the reverse conversion. Obviously, float2int and int2float will be inverses of each other.

Now, the question is why int2float(0x5f3759df - float2int(y) / 2) approximates the inverse sqrt function.

Well, this is where the luck comes in. Assuming that you got curious and started looking at the function

    f(y, m) = int2float(m - float2int(y) / 2)

and you have a plot where you can fix an arbitrary constant m, and plot out the curve for f(y, m) in terms of y, what would you see?

Well, as luck would have it, you can [try this out](http://www.phailed.me/2014/10/0x5f400000-understanding-fast-inverse-sqrt-the-easyish-way/#Adding%20Alpha).

If you plot the curve for just invsqrt(y) on the same graph, you'll notice that, as you vary m, your function is just a multiplicative factor away from invsqrt(y). That is, f(y, m)/invsqrt(y) is linear-ish, and your task is to find the value of m that makes this ratio go to 1 (or as close to 1 as you can manage for as many values of y as you can manage).

So how do we solve this problem? Well, the way that the original authors did was to treat this as a boundary value problem; e.g., use some value of y that simplifies the equations as much as possible. Their choice was to set y = 1 at one end of the boundary:

    1 = f(1, m)/invsqrt(1)

this simplifies to

    1 = int2float(m - float2int(1)/2)/1

and recalling that int2float and float2int are inverses, we have

    float2int(1) = float2int(int2float(m - float2int(1)/2)/1)
      = m - float2int(1)/2

which gives

    m = 1.5 * float2int(1)

I'll save you the troubles of computing `float2int(1)`, it is 0x3f800000, so, to satisfy the boundary condition, the magic constant would come to be `1.5 * 0x3f800000 = 0x5f400000`.

This is very close to the 0x5f3759df, so how do we close the gap? Well, it turns out that if you graph the errors of this plot, you'll notice that the error is always positive. As a result, if you just subtract a little bit off of 0x5f400000, you can actually halve the absolute value of the error by shifting half of the error down into the negative side. Finding the optimal constant is then a simple task of bisecting through viable constants while minimizing the maximum absolute value of the relative error.

This method also generalizes to arbitrary powers. It turns out that for any power, c, you can approximate y^c by

Why do I like to code?

Because it's a high paying job. Because it's a career path that's going to be around for a while. Because there's demand.

But I feel like interviewers are expecting something more moving or they want me to say my life's purpose is to code. Now don't get me wrong, of course there are specific jobs I would love to have that would make a big positive impact on the world, but as an entry level developer those jobs really aren't possible just yet.

I guess I'm just looking for some advice from fellow computer scientists. I have completed my undergraduate degree (4 years) in Computer Science. Although I love my field and was planning to go into web development, many things got in the way of finding a job right after graduation. (Mostly mental and physical health, and working in a part-time job just to save some money)

I'm curious what the best way would be to go about re-learning coding and concepts. I haven't touched anything in maybe under a year. I do not think all hope is lost as I still remember a lot of ideas and I doubt I have forgotten everything, but I do not think I can just jump back into job hunting right away.

Another question is, how would I approach an interviewer later on, if they ask me why I have not been active in coding for a year? I'm hoping to do as many projects as I can before getting an interview, but I worry that they will look at my timeline on my resume and maybe inquire.

I have since then been involved in military Space Operations and have not used my degree at all. I also never used it as a civilian either since I haven't been a civilian since 2007. Now that I'm approaching my Major's board, the military would like me to have a Master's degree (not a hard requirement however I've learned soft requirements in the military can influence your career). So I'm looking to get a master's degree in Computer science, but I have no civilian working experience and have not coded in 6 years (even then I only did it for my undergraduate). Currently at work I use Matlab on and off for mission planning but that's about it, for my undergrad I used C++ and Java. 
 My question is, how much is it going to suck? I still remember the basics but nowhere near where I should be. Are there any Computer Science refresher programs that I should look into before jumping into a master's program? Any books you all recommend? Other options are a master's in cybersecurity or a master's in Information Technology.

Lisp
ReasonML/Ocaml
Erlang
Lua

My goal is to learn a FP that will help me in the most general sense, and will show fruits early on.

I've narrowed down to two: Lisp versus Ocaml.

**Reasons for Lisp:**

* Emacs - I can learn Emacs and use org-mode!
* Paul Graham recommends it
* It's supposed to make you a better programmer

**Reasons for ReasonML/Ocaml**

* ReasonML: perhaps this is the future of React, and I'm a frontend developer.
* This will be like killing two birds with one stone: another frontend stack + FP
* Ocaml is supposedly even used in financial sectors (Bloomberg for one)
* Ocaml can compile to machine code. That by itself opens up a lot of possibilities

**Reasons for other ones**

* Erlang: apparently this was in HackerNews recently due to Elixir being a secret tool for rapid development
* Lua: I have ESP8266 boards that use Lua as the language (I changed them to use Arduino IDE at the moment), and Lua is also a scripting engine for games.. so I maybe can make adventure games..?
* Haskell: apparently this is better for something but I forgot.
* Smalltalk: learned this in school. Maybe I can get started on SICP with Smalltalk?  :) ??

Also, to be frank, a lot of the students that said that they were interested in making a chance and were tired of their situation, bailed. I unfortunately cannot be taking action for the entire computer science student body. I cannot be the only one complaining to the department, to the chair, to the school.

Just like you — I am procrastinating. Right now I am looking at my double-double and animal style fries with a Rockstar cuz I am barely gonna start studying for my cumulative final tomorrow at noon and 2:30 pm final. So your situation could be  worse, like mine. 

Don’t worry, you’ll be okay and survive finals. 

Study. Hydrate. Eat. and kick butt!

Anyways, time to get this degree!

Information surrounding Karpeles, 2bitidiot's leak, and US subpoenas is all quite vague and none of it seems to match up. We have been given ZERO conclusive information on how the bitcoins were stolen or even how long ago.

I implore everyone in this community to not just settle for this frog march of Karpeles. With bitcoin we have the ability to PROVE where these coins are.

The elephant in the room is that 800k bitcoin DO NOT just disappear without a trail on the blockchain. We have this ground breaking public ledger technology, lets not take it for granted.

Demand proof! If Gox has control of these coins or not, the BTC MUST be accounted for. Do not let this go by the wayside.  If Mt gox is not able to provide us with this proof not one person should believe the official story.


**EDIT: I did not lose bitcoin in MtGox. I am merely trying to spread awareness of the power blockchain has to prove or disprove claims people make about bitcoins being stolen. There are many class action lawsuits being brought against MtGox and this ability to trace the coins needs to be included in the trial.**

As pointed out by /u/codedaway below, you can also report /r/btc to reddit for violating reddit's self promotion rules.

Edit: as was pointed out by some, phishing might not be matching exactly. Wiki defines phishing as ""Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication."". I think that the last part is the most important aspect. Roger Ver and thus Bitcoin.com seems to try to disguise - with their app and what Roger Ver wrote  in the linked comment - bitcoin cash as a trustworthy entity (bitcoin). In my books this is close enough to be counted as phishing. The means might be different but the intent is the same. Please decide for yourself.

MtGox is gone. So let's prepare ourselves. 

On Tuesday, and for the rest of the week, all hell will break lose in the media. It will be blamed on MtGox, it will be blamed on Bitcoin, it will be blamed on the ""bug,"" and it will, more than anything, be blamed on the ""lack of regulation."" Pundits and ""experts"" of all types will weigh in on the calamity. It will be world news in a matter of hours.

Get ready, because it will be an ugly week. 

For all of you who lost money, my heart goes out to you.  Some people lost a little, some lost a fortune. It will make people sick, and depressed, and full of grief. Personally, I had over 550 BTC in Gox. I will never get any of that back. If misery loves company, then we'll be enjoying a grand feast today.

I should have known better, of course. I take responsibility for leaving those funds with an entity that had proven incompetence repeatedly. I chose to ignore even my own warnings, for nothing more than the sake of convenience. 

Gox is still at fault, to be sure, but I have learned the lesson. I hope it is not such an expensive lesson for others. And for all you observers, please take a moment to consider it as well.

Be mindful, however, that the wrong lessons are not learned, for that would be the true tragedy, indeed.

Let me suggest that the lesson is not that Bitcoin is broken. Bitcoin is fine.

Similarly, the lesson is not that security is impossible. Those who know what they are doing, can achieve it and help others to do so.

The lesson is not that nobody can be trusted. There are countless good men and women in this community who are worthy of trust, and some of the very best people I've ever met.

And finally, the lesson is not that we ought to seek out ""regulation"" to save us from the evils and incompetence of man. For the regulators are men too, and wield the very same evil and incompetence, only enshrined in an authority from which it can wreck amplified and far more insidious destruction. Let us not retreat from our rising platform only to cower back underneath the deranged machinations of Leviathan.

The proper lesson, if I may suggest, is this: We are building a new financial order, and those of us building it, investing in it, and growing it, will pay the price of bringing it to the world. This is the harsh truth. We are building the channels, the bridges, and the towers of tomorrow's finance, and we put ourselves at risk in doing so. 

We are at risk from accidents. We are at risk from fraud, from corruption, and from evil. We are at risk from journalists seeking headlines and from politicians seeking power and glory. We are at risk from the very market we are trying to build - a market which cares not about our portfolio, our ambitions, or our delicate sympathies. 

For all these risks, devastation will befall us repeatedly. Some of us will be discouraged. Some will be ridiculed and insulted. Some will be tricked, or swindled. Some of us will be crushed or caged. We will be set upon by all manner of antagonists, repeatedly, for a long time.

So why do we do it?  Why do we build these towers that fall down upon us? Why do we toil and strain and risk our precious time, which is the only real wealth we possess? 

Because the world needs what we're building. It needs it desperately. If that matters to you, as it does to me, then hold to that thought. You will see through the smoke, and your wounds will heal.

So shake it off, brothers, for this won't be the last calamity endured before the win.

Tonight, my heart is with you all. 

Tomorrow, my head is down. My eyes are open. And I am building.

Toward peace and freedom,

-Erik Voorhees",1393332904

I was asked this pretty neat question during an interview and it's really stuck with me. The question:

> You're working at a light bulb company and are tasked with testing a new shatterproof light bulb. You need to find out what floor the light bulb shatters from. You have access to a 100 story building, and only 2 light bulbs. You know the light shatters within those 100 stories. If both lights shatter but you find the floor, you succeed. It's Friday, and you can't go home until you're done. Therefore, you should try to **complete it as fast as possible.**

I've been thinking about it a lot and how to completely optimize this problem. My initial answer was:
>!Drop the first light bulb from the 50th floor. If it breaks, start at 1 and go one floor at a time. If it doesn't, go to the 75th floor, repeat. This is an OK answer, but it's definitely not optimal. There's a 50% chance that break height h is less than 50. If so, you have to try 50 floors, + 1 for the initial drop.!<

Take a second to think about how you would answer the question and any optimizations you could make to do it faster.
Here's my furthest optimized answer: >!Drop the first light bulb every 10 floors until it breaks. Once it breaks, you've narrowed it down to a 10 floor range. At a maximum (90+ break height), this takes 10 drops. Then, starting at the minimum of that 10 floor range, drop at each even floor (or you could do odd). This takes 5 drops. Conclusion, at a max, this method will take 15 drops to find the answer.!<

I'd love to see what other ideas people have!",1577966403

&#x200B;

So , I am new in CS field and I am looking for ways to improve my algorithmic  and problem solving skills. Basically  trying to think more like a ""modern"" programmer.

I have found hackerrank and tones of similar sites with problems to improve my skills but I really don't know if its worth it focusing there or if its better to improve my skills while working on a project.

Also I have some experience with programming languages.Most with C/C++ and Python , but I don't know which language is ""the best"" for problem solving. I've seen many people recommending python but   for me C++ (although its harder ) feels more ""absolute"" in syntax than Python.

So a sum up:

1. What do you recommend to me for improving my problem solving skills.
2. What language should I choose for it?

Thanks in advance",1586470429

You’ll be an idiot like me and line up near the elevators at Nutwood. You’ll find that there’s an extremely low person exiting the structure to time spent waiting ratio. As you see an hour has passed, you’ll get out of the line and head to lots A&G because the CSUF website says 1460 spots are “available” and you figure what’s there to lose? Turns out parking lot is FULL. You’ll see that there’s Lot A South parking and want to test your luck there. As you pull in, There will be a line, so you wishfully hope that assisted parking is in effect since other cars or there too!!! WRONG. The lot is fucking closed. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Every car in line has to make a loop through the lot to exit. Manically go back to Nutwood. Class is now less than an hour away. You’ll just about start to cry but hold it in since you don’t want to look like a hot mess already during the first week of school when you walk into class late. 


DO: Fucking book it to CSUF parking at 2AM!!!! Hopefully there’ll be one tiny spot for your fucking car!!!!!! I found luck coming to campus at 1:35AM and sleeping in my trunk for my morning class!!! Honestly, parking gets SOOOOO much better after the first few weeks. You’ll only need to show up around 3:15AM during mid September to get a spot!!! The $285 permit you spent on campus parking will be so worth! It’s soooooo much more convenient! TITANS REACH FUCKING HIGHER YALLL

If you were an integral role in a project's development, would they let you still have access to it even if you were to work somewhere else if it were unrelated?

EDIT: This thread is either ""NO NO NO!"" or ""I have every piece of code I've ever written..."" -- I think I'm going to ask. Though I figure, I could just remove the sensitive stuff and take the concepts I like and apply them to something different. (Maybe keeping the WHOLE repo would be a bad idea)",1545404811

1917,CFXBWB23SQU1EDR8EHCNLWXHZ,lgiordani,I wrote a free book about TDD and clean architecture in Python,Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ai9em2/i_wrote_a_free_book_about_tdd_and_clean/,"In December 2018 I published on Leanpub a free book, ""Clean Architectures in Python"". It's a humble attempt to organise and expand some posts I published on my blog in the last years, and has already been downloaded by more then 3,000 readers.

You can find it here: https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python

The main content is divided in two parts, this is a brief overview of the table of contents

* Part 1 - Tools - Chapter 1 - Introduction to TDD - Chapter 2 - On unit testing - Chapter 3 - Mocks

* Part 2 - The clean architecture - Chapter 1 - Components of a clean architecture - Chapter 2 - A basic example - Chapter 3 - Error management - Chapter 4 - Database repositories

Some highlights:

- The book is written with beginners in mind

- It contains 3 full projects, two small ones to introduce TDD and mocks, a bigger one to describe the clean architecture approach

- Each project is explained step-by-step, and each step is linked to a tag in a companion repository on GitHub

The book is free, but if you want to contribute I will definitely appreciate the help. My target is to encourage the discussion about software architectures, both in the Python community and outside it.

I hope you will enjoy the book! Please spread the news on your favourite social network

The book will soon be translated into Russian by Алексей Пыльцын (Alexey Pyltsyn), who already worked on the translation of technical books like ""The Majesty of Vue.js 2"" and ""The Road to learn React"".

Alexey is a web developer and maintainer of the official PHP documentation in Russian. His website is https://lex111.ru/.

Hey there, everyone!

Carol again to remind you about our bonfire tomorrow, we’ve got all of the final details sorted and would like to share that info with you!

Here’s what’s going down-

We will be meeting tomorrow at 5-6 PM at Huntington Beach in between Main and 1st Street. Actual, final location will be posted tomorrow in the “announcements” channel the second we find a pit, and will also be posted on here just to ensure everyone who’d like to come can see it. 

A list of snacks and food we’d like everyone to consider bringing if they can was just posted on the “announcements” channel by Victoria, for you to reference and look over. If everyone could contribute at least one or two items, it’s sure to be a great time. 

While we eat, we’ll be playing music (be sure to check out the collaborative Spotify playlist and add to it if you want), playing around in the ocean, taking tons of pics, and getting a few games going. 

We’ll end the night with the best way to end any bonfire, s’mores!!!! 

If you’re coming through, please remember to bring a towel, chair, or blanket for yourself! 

Also, feel free to wear your CSUF merch to rep your Titan pride! 

Lastly, in order to get an idea of how many snacks and drinks we need to buy, please fill out the following google survey if you will be attending: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevXVSc8WmJRPLO4zJslNtUCK9zIBue58VCRr-Y2tYbwmo4Tg/viewform

This survey is also available in the “announcements” channel. 

That’s about it, hit me up via PM or in the comments below if you’ve got any questions!

Thanks everyone!

\-Carol :)",1566036316

The god damn ""i-told-ya-so"" from John. ""I have no idea how stocks or anything like that work but i know bullshit when i see it. I can't believe people were dumb enough to buy fake money.""

Yea ok mate, if i need a status update on that box of donuts in the break room, you're my go-to guy. other than that? shut up and go back to being shit at your job.

Then you've got Becky, flapping her useless mouth in the background who ""knew"" bitcoin was a scam when her boyfriend's Sister's cousin told her that the ""bitcoin inventor guy"" posted on his website that he was selling all his bitcoin.

""Money can't just be numbers on screens, that's not how money works. it has to be something you can hold as well! With all this net neutrality stuff going on you'd be crazy to invest in money that they can just shut down with the flick of a switch!""

Becky, last week i heard you ask the IT guy if you needed two mice plugged in to your computer if you want to use two screens at once and now you have a working knowledge of both the monetary system, crypto currencies AND the internet?! that's very impressive.

I have no idea why this is annoying me so much, I just found the need to rant while waiting for a meeting to start.

Edit: people seem to have come to some weird conclusions that i've been doing nothing but come to work and try sell crypto to the entire office. the ""i told ya so"" isn't directed at me or anyone in particular, it's just general chatter around the office. i'm not printing out weekly bitcoin news letters to put on peoples desks or waiting by their car at night to ask why they haven't bought BTC.

Try not to jump to conclusions based on a semi-satirical piece of information.

Don't be a John or a Becky

I'm a CS student and I've read recently Mark Weiser's paper. He talks mainly about ubiquitous computing. I loved the paper btw.

I want to discuss some concepts that he talks about. I know that it's a paper from 1997 but still, it's a good one. 

Please, read the paper here:

[https://www.ics.uci.edu/\~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf)

It's really worth, and it's just 8 pages long. 

Now you've read it. Let's talk :)

So, IoT is the ubiquitous computing that he was talking about, right? At first, I thought of cellphones, but those still have 'a demanding focus of attention', the screen. But IoT, those are devices that we do not *see,* I see a coffee machine not a computer, I see a better fridge, a better clock, a better oven. Not computers. Those *disappeared*.

He talked about pads or tabs. We can say that these are today's smartphones and tablets, right? And the boards, we may think of them as today's smart TVs, but a big screen is just not that popular. But today smartphones, smart TVs and tablets are still not a form of ubiquitous computing so... quite similar but not exactly what he thought.

I think that the network that Mark describes here is already invented:

>Present technologies would require a mobile device to have three different network connections: tiny range wireless, long range wireless, and very high speed wired. A single kind of network connection that can somehow serve all three functions has yet to be invented.

4G. 5G. If I misunderstood let me know. 

Here's the final paragraph of the paper: 

>There is more information available at our fingertips during a walk in the woods than in any computer system, yet people find a walk among trees relaxing and computers frustrating. Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.

I think that this is yet to happen. And that will always be like that because technologies evolve so fast that the majority of society just can't catch up. 

Maybe ubiquitous computing is not even possible. It's just a utopic concept. And trying to get to that utopic place where computers vanished into the background will make great things happen, even if we never get there. 

Or maybe ubiquitous computing isn't good at all. What do you think?

I'm amazed by how he talks about things that we see today, before those things ever existed! 

Any insight from the paper, please comment :)

PS: I hope to upload some interviews with some CS Doctors of my Uni or simply a blog post about ubiquitous computing somehow soon. Thanks for taking the time of reading this, I know it's long :)",1568972648

I showed interest in going to an online school for a degree in computer science. This morning at 10:00 DeVry University called me and talk to me for about 45 minutes before they offered me a chance to join their upcoming computer science program for a associates degree. I am 44 years old, I basically was the biggest a****** in high school and did not do any school work didn't do anything though somehow ended up graduating only by myself not with my class (Long story lol). Anyway I love building computers I love learning about computers I love everything about computers I've been doing masonry and construction work since I was out of high school. I cannot take it anymore. I have an 8-year-old daughter and I want to be able to do better for her so I figured this is my next step. I'm already at the end of the process for the FIFCA(something like that) student loan process. Right now I am unemployed and I figured it is the perfect time to start something like this. And then possibly move on and get my bachelor's. I live in a pretty big area in between New York and Philadelphia and thought about making my own computer repair business where I would travel to people's houses and fix any issues they have with them. And also I would build computers if people wanted a certain kind of computer I would build it for them. I've had many people ask me to already. I just really want to get into knowing the technical details and really learning about computers. I'm leaving my options open I'm just going for an associates In computer science with an open end I suppose from what I was told there are three different routes I could take after that to get a bachelor's degree. Just wondering if anyone had opinions? thoughts? I start and just over two weeks and I have never been excited for school in my life and now I cannot wait. And I'm at the age of that and there's no such thing as too much information. Thank you for your time reading this, hoping it was coherent enough for you to get an understanding where I want to go with my life and maybe some perspective from some people who are there or have been there.",1587212201

Just look at my post history.Below I have listed each time. Do you know how I call these. It is so easy as you just have to see the FUD and how thick it gets. Same characters are always involved China, WSJ, CNBC and a army of new posters that spread some serious FUD on both reddit and bitcoin talk. Most posters are new and less than 1 month history on reddit, but they come in droves. 

Here it is for the newbies once again and you need to hammer this in your brain. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH BITCOIN SUPPLY. 16.5 million outstanding and 4-5 million lost through bad passwords and failed hard drives. 2.5-3 million held by the original people like Satoshi ( I am convinced it is the deceased Hal Finney), Craig Wright ect. 4-5 million coins held by Hodlers. It leaves only 5-6 million coins between 20+ major exchanges and the entire WORLD. I keep seeing all this TA, but this is not a stock. The people that sell are going to regret it again, and again. If you are in over your head and need it for bills you should have never bought this. This is when the weak hands get slaughtered. 

I just bought some more at 3915 and keeping another chunk for 3500-3600 range which not sure if it will hit. Take advantage of the FUD. 

Also I really hope China finally bans it outright. they will soon realize you can't ban a decentralized network. They should also ban mining while they are at it. This will be the best news in a long time. I really have a hard time believing China capital outflow theory. There is something else going on, and it could actually be a group of people in China are making major $$$ through the buy/ FOMO / sell / short /FUD / cover / buy. Why else would the second largest economy in the world go after something over and over for the last 4 years. Bitcoin will be so much stronger without these people just like when we split from the big blockers. 

In addition look at all the new tech headed are way. Lightning network, MAST, Schnorr Signatures, and on and on.

1) I realized many departments that are very dependent on computer science (I actually work in analytics, not software development), are just full of people with no formal training on it.  They will write awful code and have no idea why it runs so poorly.  I seem to have a knack for cleaning it up, but it feels strange to always be advising people on something I have no formal training on.


2) Yes, you can google the answer to anything, but you don't know what you don't know.  And a teacher will force you to study the boring parts that many self taught people overlook.  I have coworkers who desperately need to learn the low level differences between integer and character variables; and don't know how big of a gap this is in their practical knowledge.


3) I've been exposed to some communities of self taught programmers who will brag about things they built in python like they think it's brand new computer science, while obviously having no idea if they built the Taj Mahal or a child's pillow fort.  I'm NOT here to bash python, this is just to show a pitfall of pure self taught knowledge.


4) I actually like theory!  I love math (was close to finishing an undergrad in math) and was considering pursuing an advanced degree in math, but my favorite kind of mathematics is all around computer science, so thought a comp sci degree would be a better option while also being more relevant to the jobs I want.


Finally, I wanted to say that I love my program so far!  I've already learned a lot of the ""boring but important"" things I was previously missing.",1531176191

It means I can generate 9! Sudoku's for 9 x 9. 12! for 12 x 12....**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have created an algorithm that generates n! Sudoku Grids in poly-time.I verified the correctness of my grids with a SAT solver up to 50x50. I'm awaiting a review for improvements. Seems that its in O(n\^3) time. *I am saying valid complete Puzzles can be generated in poly-time. Not solving arbitrary puzzles in poly-time.*

&#x200B;

Input should be like a tuple. **\[1,2,3....\]** and no repeating elements.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

        tup = input()[1:-1].split(',')
        
        x = input('Enter mapping to generate valid Sudoku eg. 3 for 9 x 9')
        e = input('Enter 9 for 9 x 9 ...12 for 12 x 12')
        f = input('Enter 3 if its a 9 x 9 and corresponding for n^2 x n^2')
        
        x = int(x)
        e = int(e)
        f = int(f)
        
        squares = []
        
        for index in range(len(tup)):
          tup.append(tup.pop(0))
          squares.append(tup.copy())
        
        #Everything below here is just printing
        
        for s in range(x):
          for d in range(0,e,f):
            for si in range(s,e,f):
              for li in range(d,d+f):
                print(squares[si][li], end = '')
            print('')

SAT-Solver validated my 50x50 grids. That's 65 decimal digits of valid Sudoku Puzzles and grids!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

SideNote: If you want to create 12 x 12 or any larger Sudoku's. You'll need to edit the input so that the values are readable. eg. \['\[01\]','\[02\]',....\]

&#x200B;

If you copy and paste, you'll get indent errors. So here's a link.

Dear Colleagues,

We are all currently facing extraordinary challenges with COVID-19; if not from the virus itself then from its many and long-reaching effects. To help address these challenges and to encourage our students to persist and complete their academic course work this semester, Cal State Fullerton will institute a temporary modification in our academic grading processes.

Created transparently and in collaboration with our ASI leaders, Academic Senate Executive Committee, Academic Senate, deans, faculty, staff, students, and administration, this modification will empower students with the **option** of moving any and/or all of their Spring semester 2020 courses from a letter grade to Credit / No-Credit (CR/NC). Further, unlike most CR/NC selections, in this instance, students will be given this option *after* they learn their grade in the course, thereby allowing them to choose the grading option that best suits their situation—either a letter grade or a CR/NC.

Specifically, the plan for this change, which is for Spring 2020 courses only, is as follows:

* All courses (undergraduate and graduate) will be available for the CR/NC grading option on the following basis:
   * Undergraduate CR/NC grading:  CR = A through C- grades; NC = D through F grades.
   * Graduate courses CR/NC grading: CR = A through B- grades; NC = C through F grades.
* The deadline for students to select CR/NC grading options will be extended to June 1, 2020.
* Faculty members will submit students’ letter grades by May 22 as they typically would.
* The students will then have a 10-day period to review their grades and determine either to retain the assigned letter grade or to opt into the equivalent CR/NC grade.
* Should students want to opt into CR/NC:
   * There will be a video tutorial presented to the students showing them the step by step process for opting into the CR/NC option.
   * Students will login to their Student Center in Titan Online and access a new page where they can opt in for CR/NC, course-by-course. They will answer questions pertaining to the implications of their decision and acknowledge their understanding before they can indicate their decision.
   * Students will decide course by course whether to retain their letter grade or select the equivalent CR/NC option.
   * After a student has chosen the CR/NC grading option for a course, they may change that decision up until the deadline of June 1, 2020.
* At the end of the review period, June 1 at 11:59 p.m., grades will be finalized on transcripts, per the Office of the Registrar.
* If a student does not opt into the CR/NC grade for any particular course, the letter grade will serve as the default official grade.
* We are also extending the deadline to withdraw from a class for non-medical reasons to May 8, 2020, the last day of classes. The Chancellor’s Office has waived sections of EO 1037 for this semester, so that Spring 2020 withdrawals will not count towards the normal 18-unit limit on withdrawals.

Since the benefits to these modifications will impact individuals differently,

* the University will provide advising early and often to ensure students are equipped to make the grading choices that best serves their unique goals and needs. 
* students with questions about Financial Aid impact should go to the Financial Aid website for a quick reference on CR/NC.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

* [**FAQ document for students**](http://coronavirus.fullerton.edu/credit-no-credit-grading-basis-for-csuf-students/)
* [**FAQ for faculty/staff**](http://coronavirus.fullerton.edu/credit-no-credit-grading-basis-for-faculty/)

We know that these actions alone cannot relieve all the difficulties related to COVID-19, but we hope they will alleviate at least some of the academic-related stress. We have made these temporary changes with our central focus on informed student choice and flexibility. We are grateful for all that our faculty and staff are doing each day to continue instruction and all that our students are doing to continue learning under these challenging circumstances. Together and as Titans, we will persevere, we will overcome, and we will succeed. 

In so many ways, we already are.

Thank you, Titan Family.

Sincerely,

I have twenty-five S9 miners inside these greenhouses. They are all running 100% off grid with solar and battery power.

I posted my numbers for this mining operation in the desert a few hours ago but it was downvoted into obscurity. Here is the link if anyone is interested:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6kiifr/another_update_on_my_solar_powered_farm_and/

Anyhow, I kinda think that this sub is controlled by miners. I want to test this out to see if it might be true. Cuz...maybe I am just being weird and got it wrong. For the record, I am often wrong.

So here it goes...I have documented my mining operation over the last year here on Reddit. I detailed my idea from when it was just an idea all the way to today, where I have a fully functional and profitable bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the desert....not connected to the grid at all. I am about to go all-in and buy 1,000 miners for the September shipment of new S9's.

Here are the numbers for mining, for those of you who are interested. You will need 6 kw of solar panels. And you will need 15 deep cycle lead-acid batteries (24V/200 amp hours each). And a power control system. I buy the batteries from China for $180 each. I pay $0.45 per watt for solar panels. Total cost for the off grid solution for ONE miner is $6800. It costs so little because I found the suppliers on AliBaba and negotiated my pricing. I am happy to share the suppliers with anyone who is interested (no one will be interested).

Cost for one S9 is $1225 landed on your door in the US. Total cost for the off grid mining solution is $8,000. I make .007 btc per day from each miner. This is about $18 per day at the current price. I make about $300 profit on each miner by reselling it (used). I can buy and sell these miners EVERY time there is a production run from Bitmain. I get in early and secure my order. Then I slowly sell them until the next batch is close to shipping.

I am pretty sure that there are LOTS of miners doing this and they don't want anyone else doing it. They are afraid of flooding the resell market. And they are afraid of increasing demand for miners. And I am pretty sure those people are now running this sub. But again, maybe I am wrong. We'll see...

Basically, I feel that there is a real effort to dissuade people from mining so that miners can continue to do this.

I purchase in advance from Bitmain and secure the lower pricing. I buy 100 miners and I run 25 of them.  I then begin to resell the remainder of my miners. There is such a long gap between shipments from Bitmain that the price just keeps going up and I profit on the resell of these machines. Meanwhile, I am using them to mine until they sell.

By reselling the miners I am making sure I am current with the fastest miners. I also profit from buying 100 miners early in the cycle to resell.

I have NO idea why this happens, but every time I post about mining and talk about how I have found what I believe to be an awesome idea for small to medium sized miners, I am down voted and called a liar and con man by a lot of people here.

So, I am testing my hypothesis. I think that one of three things will happen to this post: (1) it is down voted to obscurity  (2) I am relentlessly called out for being a liar and con man (3) no one cares.

For the record, this should be a post that is read by many people here. I am not trying to say that it is the most amazing thing that someone will read here. But, this is exactly the type of post that should have people discussing in a bitcoin forum.

Anyhow, for those who are interested, this info is not a FAKE POSTING. The numbers are real. I am highly profitable. I wish others would do the exact same thing. I want everyone to be mining.",1498900120

&#x200B;

I am a HS Comp Sci and I have noticed that we have a serious problem in Computer Science education... at least at the high school level. Either students get a teacher that has little to no knowledge of programming, or they get a teacher that is a programmer, but not the skills to teach. Often times even if the teacher has programming and teaching abilities, a better job offer comes along to pay them more. The result is that the students suffer because great teachers aren't paid enough to hang around, especially in CS. Online tutorials are helpful, but that doesn't help the students with little CS experience or knowledge to pull from.

&#x200B;

I understand that teachers get tons of days off and we are ""off"" around 3. But if you ask a teacher, they're days-off are often spent grading and lesson planning. The thought that we get off at 3 is ridiculous... And to prevent me from going in to a rant that nobody wants to listen to, I will leave it at that. 

&#x200B;

My point is that I am frustrated that there isn't a bigger emphasis on CS education in general, more professional development incentives for teachers in CS, or some way to just get better CS teachers. I am not sure there is an easy answer to this, but wanted to know some thoughts and make people outside the CS education aware of this frightening fact when the future growth of CS is so immense.",1557273574

I've been thinking real hard about my future and looking at the schooling needed in psychology before I can really start working in the field. I dont want to do it. I can't see myself being a therapist and having a bachelors in psych won't cut it for the field. I already switched my major from computer networking to psych during my first term because that major wasn't a transfer degree, it was an applied degree meant for those looking to work after their associate's. 

My  community college offers a transfer degree in computer science and I've been thinking about switching majors to that. I'm not too far along in my degree right now, so most if not all of my classes so far would transfer over and I would just take different classes in the future. I love computers and I took an intro to computer science class in high school two years ago and liked it. It was hard but i was able to figure everything out and i loved the way I had to think in order to complete projects.

I would have already switched but the only thing holding me back is, of course, math. When I took my colleges placement test, I was placed into math 10 which is one class above adult basic skills. This is the very beginning of the math sequence. I already completed math 10 and would be at math 20 leaving about 8 or 9 math classes before I get my associate's and am at calculus level math. This means at least 3 years at my community college before I can transfer to a 4 year with junior standing.

Would you say this is worth the switch? I'm willing to put in the work and I dont hate math, I just had no idea of what I was doing in high school which led me to falling behind and not taking a math class my senior year. I really like psychology and learning about people, but I think I have more of a future in computer science, especially since I'm thinking about going into the FBI. There's also a lot of local software companies I'd be able to and love to work at.

Have any of you been in the same situation? How'd it go?

He believes bitcoin will go up so much that it he'll have no choice but to use it in the future.

I am looking for contributors for my project, [autostack](https://github.com/autostack-team/autostack). autostack is a command-line debugging tool that captures raised python exceptions, automatically searches stack overflow for an answer to the exception, and displays the answer in the console with syntax highlighting!

I actually entered this into a hackathon (CrimsonHacks 2019) and placed top 5. However, I am now looking to expand this to other languages besides python, add smarter Stack Overflow queries, and even create VS Code and Atom extensions.

Literally anyone interested in this project can start making changes and submitting pull requests. After a few contributions, if you'd like to become a collaborator, that's a possibility too! Not to mention that this project is definitely beginner friendly!

Checkout the repo at [https://github.com/autostack-team/autostack](https://github.com/autostack-team/autostack)! Looking forward to hearing from you guys!

Thanks,

But in 3.7 dicts **officially** became ordered:

> Performing `list(d)` on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, **in insertion order**

(from https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

TBH, I'm not sure that this is a good idea. I can see a number of problems with this change in future:

1. Now people will start relying on the order of elements in a dict and if Python developers want to change the implementation in future they will **have to** preserve the order as well.
2. It forces developers of other Python interpreters to implement this feature as well even if it will cost them some additional work or decrease performance.

His mathematician friend tells him that he would consider computer science a worthwhile field of study as soon as it contains 1000 deep theorems. Knuth writes that perhaps only 50 have been discovered so far.

Now, after 45 years, have we reached the milestone of 1000 deep results? What are these deep results?

The full quote from Knuth's article is below.

""One of my mathematician friends told me he would be willing to recognize computer science as a worthwhile field of study, as soon as it contains 1000 deep theorems. This criterion should obviously be changed to include algorithms as  well as theorems, say 500 deep theorems and 500 deep algorithms. But even so it is clear that computer science today does not measure up to such a test, if ""deep"" means that a brilliant person would need many months to discover the theorem or the algorithm. Computer science is still too young for this; I can claim youth as a handicap. We still do not know the best way to describe algorithms, to understand them or to prove them correct, to invent them, or to analyze their behavior, although considerable progress is being made on all these fronts. The potential for ""1000 deep results"" is there, but only perhaps 50 have been discovered so far.""",1560894627

After a lot of hard-work and sheer determination I have mostly completed my book, ""Intermediate Python"". It will receive updates over time :)

It has a couple of issues related to grammar and technical info in it. I am working on ironing them out one by one.

I was a bit lazy so didn't upload it earlier but here it is now.

I have decided to distribute it for free! I wanted to give back to this awesome community so this is what I have to offer for now. I am sure that it would help those who really want to be helped. Best of luck! 

Here are the links:

- [Html](http://book.pythontips.com)
- [PDF](http://readthedocs.org/projects/intermediatepythongithubio/downloads/pdf/latest/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/IntermediatePython/intermediatePython)

If you like this book then a simple [tweet](https://twitter.com/yasoobkhalid) and a personal email <yasoob DOT khld AT gmail DOT com> would mean a lot to me!

P.S: The book is open-source so if you find typo or technical error or just want to expand it's contents with your own knowledge then just send over a pull request :) Moreover, if you want to give me any tip then kindly pm me your email and I would let you know once I setup a tip-collection system.

**Note:** This is not related with that **paid** ""intermediate Python"" book in any way. I became aware of it today. I had been using this name internally for a couple of months. If the author of **paid** ""Intermediate Python"" has any issue with this I would be more than happy to change the name of my book because he definitely beated me to the finish line. :) 

------------------------

**Edit:**

Hey guys! All those of you who are going to use this book can really help me and motivate me by letting me know how this book supplements your day to day learning and if you are a Teacher, Assistant Professor or something of that sort then kindly let me know if you would be willing to offer this book to your students or not. :)

You already have my email address or if you want to tweet about it then you can do so at [@yasoobkhalid](https://twitter.com/yasoobkhalid).

Moreover, I really can't thank this community enough. This community has helped me a LOT over the years. If you see my Reddit profile then you can easily guess that this is the only community (/r/python) where I spend most of my time.

####Edit:

You guys can donate me if you want to by buying the donation version of Intermediate Python from [@gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/intermediate_python) :)

 It is only for $10 but if you want to pay less then kindly let me know (pm) and I can give you a custom link.

If you search the book ""Introduction to Algorithms"" by Cormen, then you will find a lot of people saying that this book is not a good book for beginners.

You probably won't care, but I would like to say a bit about why I disagree.

A beginner, to my mind, is someone who probably has not acquired patterns associated with imperative programming, e.g., nested loops, looping over arrays. In other words, not much experience programming with basic built in programming constructs. It could be someone who is coming from a functional programming language with no imperative programming experience.

If you understand the algorithms in CLRS and implement them in an imperative language, such as Python, then you will develop a library of models or chunks. These models or chunks, in turn, will help you solve future problems.

Solving a problem you haven’t seen before requires you to link existing chunks. So, the more chunks you acquire, the better problem solver you become.

From a problem solving point of view a chunk can be seen as a solution. It can also be seen as a model.

By doing this you will become a better python programmer and since many imperative languages share the same programming constructs you will become a better programmer in general. In addition, you will learn how to analyze algorithms, which is part of the essence of programming. I read a research paper about what distinguishes great software engineers. One of the things these researchers learnt was that great software engineers pay attention to details; for example, they are attentive enough to implement efficient algorithms.

So, I think, if you have some mathematical sense, and you are willing to think hard, and lack imperative programming experience then I think CLRS is great book to study.",1580438786

As a returning Python user from various languages like (Javascript, PHP, Rust, Go) I didn't remembered how painfully it is to setup a clean and isolated package management for Python.

[Never have I ever related so much to a xkcd comic. ](https://preview.redd.it/2o8wlapqk5h31.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=aff6c993cdfcceff2080731993ef6ba6ec67af25)

I tried to find alternative solutions to this annoying problem and try to stay away as much as possible to virtual envs, I feel like it messes with my OS way too much and I find the process of  ""activating"" an environment tedious as opposed to the simplicity of package managers from my previous languages. Poetry looked promising, but it's still a wrapper to simplify managing virtual environments and not an actual SOLUTION to this issue.  I then found out about [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/) which was exactly what I was looking for and found about [pythonloc](https://github.com/cs01/pythonloc) which takes a NPM approach and wondered how the hell is this not more discussed?

I'd like to hear r/Python thoughts about my concerns, I really want to like Python, but before starting a new project the tooling turns me right off.",1566140058

I really like mathematics and I'm pretty good at it. Applied Mathematics is certainly suitable for me but the thing is that I don't know if I want to choose a major that only revolves around maths. 

I also like working with technology and I have a huge passion for video games. That's why the CS major caught my interest. I have done a lot of research and I definitely took a liking to software developing and website designing. However, I have 0 experience when it comes to coding. I did a very basic programming tutorial a few days back and it was a lot of fun for me. I'd love to learn more about programming and taking this major.

I have talked to my parent about this and my dad does not support my decision at all. He is constantly arguing about how this major isn't for girls and requires people with experience. He says that CS major is for people who loves programming from a young age and started learning about it in elementary school. Even if I can make it into the major, he says that I will probably always be one of the worse and most inexperienced student and that I will have an awful time looking for jobs when everyone else is better than me. He really really really wants me to take another major like Data Science, Architecture, or something medical. Redditors who are/were in a CS major, is what my dad says true? If yes, to what extend?

Besides maths and video games, I also like art, design, photography, fashion, architecture, and biology. The reason I don't want to take the Architecture major is because it requires high grades in physics, and I am very average in physics. I don't want to study art/fashion stuff because it would be sooo hard to find a job. And I don't want to take Biology major because I'm only interested in the plants parts of it. 

Some other things I can add are that I am fairly creative and I can quickly adopt to new technology and softwares. I'm always very careful with everything to avoid mistakes and I prefer working alone and independently. Things I am bad at are languages, physical education, and writing essays.

Do you think that a Computer Science major will suit me? Even with no knowledge in programming (yet)? (I mean, we go to school to learn right?) Or is there any other major you'd like to suggest? Please, any help would be amazing! Thanks in advance :)

Edit: thanks everyone for the positive words and advice! All of you have convinced me and I have decided to choose the CS major! Thank you again, I appreciate every comment",1503270230

I've been in IT since I was 17 in 1999. I started off at a help desk, and worked my way up to a Systems Administrator where I was making 60k USD/yr. (I currently have only an associates degree with no plans to go back to school.) I was primarily a Windows domain/ network admin, with a few *nix boxes spread throughout. I had known windows batch scripting, and way back in the day had programmed in BASIC before the world was.


I had tossed around the idea of learning a programming language before, but when asked I'd often say ""Developers' brains just work differently than mine. I'm not a coder."" Programming seemed so abstract and I couldn't really wrap my head around it.  I finally decided though, to try something.

It was 2010 and I had heard a lot of Ruby on Rails and thought that Ruby would be a great language to learn. I ran through the tutorial of making a polls app at least 5 times, but I just couldn't wrap my head around it. So I gave up.


One year later I heard about python. Despite all the negative talk about python while googling for ""python vs ruby vs php vs ..."" *(GIL, speed, whitespace, duck typing, (not that I knew what ANY of that meant anyway))* I decided that I really wanted to give it a shot. I started out with codeacademy to get my feet wet, I'd tinker with idle while my wife and I would watch netflix after the kids went to bed. Then I started dreaming in code.

Have you ever had ""work dreams""? The kind you have for about 2 weeks after starting a new job that's really hard? That was python for me. Being primarily in a Windows environment it was hard to find anything for python to do initially at work. My boss didn't program, and really didn't see the value in it. Then one day I found myself needing to compare a list of files. I needed to find all the files that were in one column but not in the other. I had them in excel and after working through a formula I had my answer, but I hated it. All I wanted to do was write something like--

    select name from column1 where name not in (select name from column2);
    
Enter python and sqlite. It probably took me about 3 hours to figure it out, but I imported a csv into a sqlite table in python so I could query it. BAM! I was hooked from then on.

Every night I would tinker, read, and play. I found tons of things to automate at work, making my time so much more effective. I loved it. I became a python evangelist. I'd like to say that my boss was impressed, but really he never came around, and it frustrated me. Fast forward a year.

I had heard about the DevOps movement and though I didn't understand it completely at the time I thought that being a Developer and Systems Admin mutant sounded like a lot of fun, and something I could really be good at. 

After having a rough time with my boss one day I decided to check the local classifieds. I saw an ad for a DevOps Admin. Basically this guy needed to know hardware, networking, provisioning, something called puppet, and one of three scripting languages- ruby, bash, or python. 

I looked at puppet, and after having learned about booleans and strings and syntax from python, picking it up wasn't a problem. I got hired on the spot for $90k USD. A clean 50% raise. I use python every single day. I write scripts to check if databases back up properly, if services are up, if all 1000 of my physical servers are getting their updates, to provision RAIDs, you name it. I integrate what I write into puppet, fabric, and a host of other tools that I've learned along the way.

After doing that for a little over a year now, I'm about to hire 2 guys under me as we expand and I'm moving up to $120k USD. I'm learning django for fun and am just starting into machine learning. I check out /r/python every day, you guys have been so helpful to me along my way. And if I can learn python, anybody can!!!

TL;DR
I learned python in a year and got a 50% raise. 1 year later I got another 25% raise, all from python!

edit: percentages, oh math...

This is quite embarrassing, but thankfully I find anonymity through Reddit. I also know any advice given could potentially help other students who come across this post.

My question is - where do we find food pantries or food at CSUF? 

I know I’ve struggling to get food on the table. 

Any suggestions? Or, other suggestions outside of CSUF?

Thank you so much.",1568305839

The guy behind the channel was Indian, but he was very good.

As part of our testing, we generate some large csv files (generally 1-4 gb), which were a real pain in the ass to work with in excel. Using python and pandas, I wrote a short piece of code (200 lines) to parse our data, strip out the junk, and plot it into a presentable form.

You get the ""page is no longer available"" for other things too, like if you opened a separate tab for adding classes to your cart. Leave the page over for 2 seconds more than you should have, and it's no longer useful.

2437,BZUB2TD8TY4V4A7N3QRVKCAZB,HavocMMA,*Must read for newcomers* My friend worked in the Bitcoin industry (broker) for a couple of years and has been involved in the crypto world since 2014. This is what he had to say about the recent politics of btc when someone asked him on our crypto trading channel,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72zer0/must_read_for_newcomers_my_friend_worked_in_the/,"(He first sent this article https://medium.com/@StopAndDecrypt/thats-not-bitcoin-this-is-bitcoin-95f05a6fd6c2, then followed up with this reply when someone told him he had no idea what he just read)

""There was a big scaling debate and in the end there were two sides. Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize (short term solution that doesn't work long term and also causes more centralization) vs those who wanted to scale using changes in the code to make the network more efficient aka SEGWIT+second layer scaling solutions (bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer, and second layer solutions can take care of verifying your $3.25 coffee payment). 

On the big block side you had (most) miners because they were only able to see the short term benefits of increased blocksize and they do not care about network centralization. Also, a chinese miner controlling a sizeable chunk of the network's hashrate had access to (and was in the process of patenting) this technology called ASICBOOST which is an exploit in bitcoin code that allows you to ""cheat"" and get extra hashing power out of your miners. Essentially they had an unfair advantage and the KEY is that the segwit upgrade fixes this exploit. Alongside these miners you had a couple of misguided (but incredibly wealthy because of early adoption) individuals who either have a reason to see bitcoin fail (like they are heavily invested in altcoins now) or they are too pigheaded to back down when wrong (or some of them I'm sure are not actually intelligent enough to understand they are wrong).

On the Segwit side you had all the core developers (the guys who worked side by side with satoshi to build all this and have been contributing to the code for years every day), the majority of the userbase, AND the vast majority of bitcoin companies. The two sides were basically arguing over who had control over bitcoin - was it the miners, or was it the users? Was it those who chose which software to run (users) or was it those who verified transactions for that software (miners)? (The answer as you will see shortly is Users). So basically these miners were stalling the upgrade because it would mean the end of their unfair (AND patented) advantage. This massive stalemate in the debate caused a community led uprising known as the User Activated Soft Fork movement (UASF). These guys basically said ""We're switching our nodes to Segwit software starting Aug 1 and we will be rejecting all mined blocks that do not comply with the new code"". This forced the miners' hand as they realized they would either be forked off the network or have to go along with the new upgrade to make sure everything continued to go smoothly (including their profits).

The movement gained enough support to freak out some big money bitcoin CEOs who got together in a room with the miners and made a deal behind closed doors known as the New York Agreement (NYA). This is where Segwit2x was born. The key to note here is that not a single core dev was invited to this meeting (in fact, not a single competent dev in general was invited). The terms of the deal were: You guys agree to implement Segwit now, and then we'll agree to an increase in block size later (November). Deal was made and obviously the majority of the user community was in an uproar because bitcoiners hate closed door deals (and they should for good reason). 

That being said, it got Segwit activated because it gave miners an easy way to safe face and go with segwit and the community instead of seeing their profits get wrecked by a messy chainsplit. However, do you remember that sneaky miner who had patented the ASICBOOST technology? Well he was part of the NYA and he decided to fork off anyway and create Bitcoin Cash. So stop right here and realize that the only reason we have bitcoin cash is so that some miner with a ton of hashing power could keep his unfair advantage over the network (he stills mainly mines bitcoin by the way because he would go out of business if he switched entirely to bitcoin cash). Also at this point, technically the NYA was broken because the whole point of it was to avoid a chainsplit and go with segwit followed by a block size increase whereas bitcoin cash was a clear chainsplit.

So for a few months everything was ok because we had Segwit, core devs were still with us, and (supposedly) anyone who wanted bigger blocks had forked off to bitcoin cash right? Wrong. See it turns out that those guys who made that backroom deal with the miners also had their own interests which involve removing the current core developers from their (imagined) seat of power. It is classic old school business politics - they don't care that core the devs are based around principles of meritocracy and peer review. They just want to have more of a say in the direction bitcoin takes. At this point, you might be thinking, ""Ok but its fair for companies who use a product to have a say in its development, right?"" NO. Not when the ""product"" at stake is meant to be an incredibly secure, incorruptible ledger that can hold trillions of dollars in wealth and still be hosted online accross the world. 

The fact is that no one understands the code better than the core developers and no one has more of an interest in seeing bitcoin stay decentralized and secure than these guys do. These guys literally cum buckets everyday to how much they love coding bitcoin. If Satoshi is Cypher Jesus then these guys are his Apostles. And on the other hand you have some severely misguided corporate buffoons who think they have the knowledge to negotiate a compromise with a group who has nothing but short term profit in their sights. And when the core developers are like ""wtf dude?"" and the community stands behind them, then these guys resort to essentially trying to kick core out of bitcoin by starting a new chain. A new chain which was based on a compromise that no one wants or needs anymore. And the excuse these CEO's are hiding behind is ""We don't want to go back on our word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset.

ur word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset. 

Now we come to the current situation where there are basically 4 sides

1. Core developers, and those supporting them
2. The (remaining) signers of the NYA and those supporting Segwit2x 
3. Malicious third parties who just want to see bitcoin fail (invested in altcoins/bitcoin cash or they are the Joker and just want to see shit burn)
4. Innocent bystanders


The core developers are continuing to code and improve bitcoin and they are working on second layer solutions. They haven't stopped development and have actually made a TON of beneficial changes to the code since the Segwit upgrade allowed them to. Being non-political or atleast being shit politicians, these guys do not know how to handle themselves with other people and either don't speak much or come off as pretentious d*bags (trust me I used to hate them before I smartened up). 

The remaining NYA signers. I say remaining because alot of companies left when they saw the massive backlash from the community. The only signers left are miners and then a group of around 30 companies which all have ties to Barry Silbert's holding company Digital Currency Group and suprise surprise who do you think got that NYA meeting together in the first place? Silly Silbert indeed. He's basically trying to do a sort of corporate take over of bitcoin where he decides who is writing the code and how they write it. Oh also I should note here that these guys have 1 developer working on the Segwit2x code. Yes 1, Jeff Garzik. Coding ability? Mediocre at best. All he did was copy and paste the entire bitcoin core code (because its open source) and changed the one little value that dictates block size. He changed a 1 to a 2 haha! And when he tried to make other changes he made critical mistakes that had to be fixed by CORE DEVELOPERS hahahaha! So how the f* does that even compare to an army of geeks who have been coding bitcoin for years and coding in general for decades who are all constantly trying to find mistakes in each others' work. SO people supporting Segwit2x are either severely misguided, hate core devs, or don't have all the information to make an informed decision.

Now the malicious actors. These are people who have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin crumble. I'm talking about big altcoin investors and bitcoin cash supporters (yes the guys who have ASICBOOST and want are the reason for this whole mess in the first place). And Segwit2x has presented them with a beautiful vector of attack. Divide and conquer. Right? And whereas with bitcoin cash there was replay protection (meaning the split was pretty clean and bitcoin was largely unaffected) this time they haven't got any planned - so should things go through as planned, things could get messy.

Then you have all those innocent bystanders who don't really know what to think anymore. Things have gotten so convoluted and complicated that it is hard to follow who wants what anymore. These are the people who will get the most fucked by something like Segwit2x because they won't understand the risks as it is happening and they won't have the knowledge to know which wallets to support. Imagine Segwit2x happens and one wallet sticks with the core version of bitcoin and the other wallet supports the segwit2x version but they both just say ""Bitcoin"".
 
That is why people are soooooooooooooo strongly opposed to Segwit2x more than anything. It is nothing more and nothing less than a hostile takeover attempt. And at this point that should be more than clear because why else would you still support the compromise made with miners who broke the compromise by creating bitcoin cash? No one wanted Segwit2x in the first place. People wanted bigger blocks, or segwit, not both. Segwit2x was never a faction in the debate. It was a faction that was spawned by those who created the NYA because they saw an opportunity take control of the software development from a group of developers who have been working on it for years and who strongly oppose corporate interests getting involved in bitcoin development.""

It's been a month--and [here's my second video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVkQmEjrMwo&index=3&list=PLbWOAOC929Ky_oKFVIXYaaeIo8-7lSENe&t=3s) describing how to build an adder and a subtractor from basic logic gates. Yes, lots of ones and zeros; I welcome any feedback.

When building the adder circuit from transistors--because I want this not to be an exercise in theory, but something concrete you can lay your hands on--I discovered a mistake in the first video.

So that got edited, new animations created, and the video explains my mistake for posterity. And here's [the new version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDBAbJ-SO5E&index=2&list=PLbWOAOC929Ky_oKFVIXYaaeIo8-7lSENe)

That said, I sometimes come across what looks like “proper Python” that’s really weird to read. It abstracts a lot of things behind cls, uses tons of one liners, and now I’ve got a Dev who is enforcing strict typing on every code review (not necessarily bad, just kinda weird to see type declarations in Python).

My style typically breaks one liners into methods or multi-line flow control blocks for easier reading and understanding. I try to keep things explicit and self-explanatory for V everyone. Have I been doing it wrong?

In the hope that this will be received by the entire student body, I write to you all with the objective of bringing us together, as students, as Titans, but also as humans. As of late, we have been barraged with emails from our university, regarding our current circumstances of a potential apocalypse. I wanted to send a message not for the purpose of doom, but for the sake of camaraderie and empathy. We all know about social distancing, along with the “safer at home” order issued by the state, the panic that we see on the media from people in lines at Costco, the numbers game that airs during every news segment that minimizes human lives to either lives that may be lost or that unfortunately have been. I’m not writing this to tell you what we should be doing in the face of this global pandemic, no instead I am imploring you to be YOU. Find ways to express yourself, innovate your mind and soul out of this lonely island that we have been placed on. In times of crisis like this, we’re seeing the worst in some, but let us not forget that we are the many. We are neighbors, schoolmates, friends and more. Let us do what Titans do and shape the world with our hearts and mind. Let us reach out to one another and lift one another up so that we may all stand tall together, far away from the loneliness. Like the lamp post flags state; Titans Reach Higher and we’ll reach them together.

 Wishing all of you, and your families, good health during these turbulent times.

## What is PyBoy

In short, it’s a Game Boy emulator written from scratch in pure Python, with additional support for scripting through an API. We’ve added type definitions, which allows us to compile the software using Cython to get performance comparable to emulators written in C and C++.

## Installation

The installation instructions are simple: Install SDL2 on your system, and install PyBoy through `pip install pyboy`. If you need to compile from source, we also have detailed instructions on the GitHub Wiki for Mac, Linux and Windows.

[https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation)

## Features

PyBoy is designed to be accessible from Python, so we support and encourage people who want to make experiments, bots or AI’s to try it out. We are building game-specific wrappers, which at the moment allows programmers to interface with Tetris and Super Mario Land, without any intricate knowledge of the Game Boy. Documentation can be found at: [https://docs.pyboy.dk](https://docs.pyboy.dk/) .

We also want to learn and experiment with more exotic features. Based on work from a university project, we’ve added rewinding to the emulator. Which means, you’ll be able to turn back time in any game.

You might already know that I released a free and open source book on Intermediate Python. The name of the book itself is also [intermediate Python](http://book.pythontips.com). After my [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3hbb46/i_just_released_alpha_version_of_intermediate/) post the book received a lot of patches and it is in a whole lot better shape now. It also received a LOT of positive response from the community. It remained on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10075078) and /r/Python. It is currently a [trending](https://github.com/trending?l=python) project on [GitHub](https://github.com/yasoob/intermediatePython) under the Python tab. I am happy to say that it has entered beta stage now. This is the best time to take a look if you haven't already.

Moreover, if you want to add anything to the book or just want to polish it further then you are more than welcome to submit a Pull request on GitHub.

I just wanted to write a quick note that a lot of people asked me last time whether I accept donations. I wasn't accepting donations untill recently. I have uploaded the latest build of the book on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/intermediate_python) so if you feel like tipping me then you can buy the donation version of the book from [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/intermediate_python). It would mean a lot to me and would help me to continue writing free quality content.

I had to get a scantron and thought that the vending machine in the hallway could take cards. The machine does not take cards and I did not have any cash on me.

There was about 10 minutes before the test and I did not have time to go across the street to the main campus. There was a girl standing by the machine and I asked her if I could borrow cash from her and I could venmo her. Without hesitation, she got me a scantron and refused to let me venmo her for it and told me ""go do well on your test.""

I know the scantron costs less than a dollar, but her willingness to help and her words of encouragement really made my day. I am inspired to be kind to others and will try to help those I can in my everyday life.

I wanted to share this story in hopes that it will inspire you all to be as kind and generous as this student and hopefully, if she is reading this, say how grateful I am. Her words of encouragement really helped me to keep myself in a positive mindset during the exam.",1572657579

1) The price drop has nothing to do with anything. This is a standard Quarterly Ethnic cleansing of all noobs who came to double their money in a month. We see 30-40 % correction regularly. If you can't stomach it .. GTFO

2) Roger's Shitcoin is nothing more than a centralized pump and dump scheme. Its led by some really shady people and has actually never been battle tested. If it didn't have Bitcoin in its name then it would be trading at 5 $.

3) But we do need to recognize that we have a serious mempool issue. We can't honestly preach people that they can buy fraction of Bitcoin or that Bitcoin can solve problems in Venezuela if it bloody takes 30 $ to send a 5 $ worth of Bitcoin.

There have been studies which show that doubling the Lane size simply doubles the traffic. That will happen here too if we increase the blocksize. But problem here is that we need to survive for 2 years till we have proper long term solution which has been tested like we did for Segwit. 

I work in Tech startups as a developer. I supported the Core team over the whole 2X crises because it seemed like a hostile takeover by others over the repo and Dev team. But we need to recognize that ground reality in last 6 months has changed. We have 10X more people now. I have a complete crypto Boner for LN right now but honestly if I was working on a startup which was growing at 10-20X per year and I said that a scaling solution would come in 2 years .. I would be fired the same day.

As a developer, 2nd layer solutions make complete sense to me. Its like Horizontal vs Vertical scaling but at what mempool size do we realize that we have a problem which we need to address.

2635,BRFGTYU20HNDK0KSZN1Y0XF2V,hodlgentlemen,Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place. This used to be preaching to the choir. But these days I am not so sure.,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6rr6ph/just_a_quick_reminder_why_bitcoin_was_invented_in/,"*	People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
*	Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
*	Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.
*	Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
*	Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them. 
*	All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create. 
*	From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make. 
*	This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.
*	This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
*	What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
*	Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.
*	Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.
*	Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
*	The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.
*	When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure. 
*	What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.

So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system.

Edit: wow, thanks for the gold!

As I sit here in the bathroom of my town home gingerly unloading on my toilet I thought ""what wisdom do I have to pass on to current students at CSUF?""

The answer is pooping. I pooped a LOT at CSUF and I'm not one to repeat the same action without a dusting of innovation each time. Here's my quick guide:

Pooping at the TSU:
Whilst dumping at the student union, you must go to the bathroom with the least traffic. Remember - people eat shitty here AND beer is served downstairs. Avoid those. The bathroom in the courtyard is also high traffic. I'd you're really verbal like me avoid those.  My choice is the bathrooms towards the back near the conference rooms / auditorium dealies. These bathrooms are down a hallway on the SW side of the TSU. Only drawback? Bad reception. But read for fucks sake! You're in college. 

Pooping at College Park:
This is truly a way to dump in style. Not only are the bathrooms roomy, the equipment is top notch AND the wifi signal is good! My pro tip is to pick a floor that's mostly administrative faculty. You don't want one professors are on. I believe 4 was my old favorite, but don't quote me on that. You'll find lots of room to spread out here in the disabled stall (or the suite a I call it) with a nice hook to hang your backpack. It's worth the walk. 

Other buildings on campus:
Since I covered the opposite bases of CP and TSU, I figured I should tell you about my middle ground. When I had classes in other buildings but had enough time poop between, I'd hit the library for a vintage poop. For a spooky surprise, hit the top floor of the taller building! The lights will usually be off in half the place but the bathrooms are always well lit! Because they're mostly old equipment, be prepared for some cool mod colors in the bathroom and smaller butt-area on the actual unit. Take a trip into the 70s when you latch the door and pretend you were a hippie pinching one off at the man's library. 

I hope this is able to help some folks have a better time on the John - keep that iPhone handy and remember! Always always check the paper supply before you let one fly. ",1350775289

For example, if you sit outside in Campus you will most likely get asked about taking a survey for a class, or signing a petition, or donating money. I remember there were people last semester who came to the campus wearing red shirts who claimed to be apart of a church in Santa Ana asking for donations. Well that ""church"" was on the news last night being investigated for fraud. Then you have the Jehovah Witnesses who walk around campus claiming they are students who need to do an assignment about religion but are really trying to teach you about their religion. Then there is this heavy set African American guy who wears a backpack and approaches you asking about your day and then at the end he asks for money. The funny thing is is that that last guy keeps coming back to me whenever he sees me even though I tell him I'm busy or gets up to leave. Have any of you ever encountered anyone like this on campus? I feel that its annoying that people can't sit outside to study, read, or be on their phone without being bothered by someone.

Rapes, stabbings, suicides, and bringing a gun to the parking structure have been less acknowledged by the school then some stupid dude writing the N word on a poster. I barley found out about the professor killing himself today when it happened 2 weeks ago, yet I get spammed on my emails from top people of the school because someone wrote the N word somewhere? For most of the stuff like the suicide and the gun being brought on campus I had to find out through other people. It’s kinda stupid what is being brought into light and what isn’t.",1572005653

A couple of months ago I’ve done something that I never thought I'll do… that was to mentor someone to learn how to code in python.  

Here’s the course lessons/projects on GitHub: [https://github.com/purcellconsult/Cracking-Python-Bootcamp](https://github.com/purcellconsult/Cracking-Python-Bootcamp)

Instead of including tons of dry text that makes the eyes hurt, I figured that I’ll try something a little different. For a little backdrop, each lesson was initially a live coding session that used a combo of Google Docs/Skype. After each lesson I added the code to a python file, wrote comments, and pushed it to GitHub.  

I tried to make the code as self-documenting as possible so that it makes intuitive sense. I think this approach is more hands-on and thus inspiring for those who have an appetite to learn how to code. Anything that’s not clear can be Googled along the way which IMHO reduces the learning curve.

I am at the beginning of my computer science studies and i am working on a specific problem for quite some time now.

You  are trying to build a wall. For each row of the wall you have a set of  bricks of the length 1 to N and you need to use every brick exactly  once. Now you try to build the highest possible wall for a given N  without any joint being on the same column.

Here is an example for N = 4:

[Wall N = 4](https://i.redd.it/6lpxvi727ca31.png)

My challenge for you is now to find a solution for the highest N possible.

The height each wall with a given N should reach is floor(N / 2) + 1.

For  reference my record is N = 395 with around 5 hours of computing time  (for N = 163 i need around 10 seconds) but i am sure you guys can do  much better then me.

I am open for questions and can explain my current algorithm if needed.

Happy coding and let me know about your results.

Look familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).

This wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050

This address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD

The following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

I'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?

*Edit: I believe this was actually to ensure they had BTC for transaction fees moving the tethers around*

At 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Then at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.

At 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/e7e09cd092a5febdcae6b2ec76b06389c29298ed237dd1f210e1e54f096f1f92

These tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r

The 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Following the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:

https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579

It's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=2147484016

The BTC from the tether wallet ended up in these addresses:

https://blockchain.info/address/1HtmVRdFRqPScH7Ud6UFR6HUcndksjVmua

https://blockchain.info/address/155KG55pRsV1Y9jdwwynfGHGqR9cqPKToB

https://blockchain.info/address/1M8b8BNMEMFFem9UQpZydoespHzXjAnC9t

I will update this post as more develops.

*Edit 1*

This wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC from Huobi in late 2015, interesting...

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d

*Edit: Huobi are saying this is not a hack, so who knows why 12000 or so bitcoin was withdrawn from their exchange and combined with the coins from bitstamp [see here](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d) before being passed through several more wallets and onto BTC-e in batches of 1000 or so.*

Before he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/02f08eddae4ba788

So Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)

*Edit 2*

So I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.

Well, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.

Some of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.

Also if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.

It could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.

*Edit 3*

There is a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ei568/tether_return/) in which a /u/bitconexfoier1 claims to have bought 10M tethers, and provides an address that [received 10 million tethers](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=13kyHqsbtZpRHDNSdXWniJiCZPvRtMjVao) (now invalid) from the hackers.

I feel like what you really mean to be asking is ""How do I get where I want to be?"". In order to answer that question, you need to know where that is.

There are many different reasons why someone would want to learn how to program and I feel like when the question of ""Where do I start?"" is asked, the response is never quite right.

Generally you see the same responses. Youtube, Code Camp, College but it's not really the answer you were looking for. You want to know how to create a piece of software. The first step to doing that is learning the basics of a programming language. Tutorials and books are a great [start](http://www.youtube.com) to doing this but just knowing the languages basic syntax isn't enough.

When you finally get the basics of a language down you will have the skills you need to start a project. This includes knowing variables, conditions, loops, operators, data types, functions, classes and documentation. This process doesn't actually take very long, college classes usually take about two semesters to teach this but it can be [self-taught](https://www.udemy.com/) a lot quicker. When you get to this point you can start working on your first project.

In the process of creating your first project, whether it be a random number generator or a fully equipped web application, you will be researching and further teaching yourself what you need to know to finish. The process will be slow and at times frustrating but the next time you run into a similar problem, you'll know exactly what you need to do to fix it.

There is a possibility that your project won't turn out quite as imagined, but the entire process was a learning experience. When you choose to tackle your next projects you will then have those skills learned from the previous project to make the process a lot easier.

An important thing to note is that developers (and artists) will get overwhelmed trying to create every feature that they envisioned in their application at one time. There is a process to everything and you have to remember to take your time. Get something as close to what you want it to be on the screen. It can be extremely buggy and look terrible but if it's serving the function you created it to do you are on the right track. You can worry about the cosmetics later.

Another important note is that there are a ton of [resources](https://stackoverflow.com/) to help ease this entire process. Linked throughout this post are a few. There are also a lot of different tools and platforms used to create these applications. It is all dependent on what you are trying to get done. If you wanted to create a dynamic web site you would want to learn HTML and CSS. If you wanted to add some advanced functionality to that website such as a user log in system, you would possible learn JavaScript and NodeJS. If you wanted to learn how to create video games you would more than likely learn a C language and use a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine. It is all extremely situational.

Finally, i'd like to share the most important advice I've ever received in the field. That advice is: don't reinvent the wheel. If there is something you need to get done, chances are someone has done it for you and they are allowing you to use that in your software. An application is usually like a big puzzle that has been put together by the developer. For example: The popular video game ""Fortnite"" was created in the Unreal Engine mentioned above. They didn't go through and create their own engine with collision and artificial gravity from scratch. That would be expensive and a waste of time. They used a resource that was already available to them and added their own software and style to it and created one of the worlds most popular video games.

I hope that this post helps people who are interested in getting into the computer science field or learning programming. It's a great skill to have and it can be extremely rewarding but it takes a lot of patience. Keep learning and working and eventually you will be where you want to be.

You might like a long-term project I try to build. It is a
datavisualization that aims to cluster movie posters and propose the ''closest'' movie
poster.

The project is divided into two part:

* [a search engine](https://movies.iwoaf.com/index_complete.html) that allows you to find
  the closest posters of a particular movie (have fun with the random button)..
* [a scatter plot](https://movies.iwoaf.com/) representing 1500 randomly picked movie posters into a 2D spaces.

Don't forget that, for both of the webpages, you can click on any movie poster to get its closest posters.


**General idea:**

I thought you'd be interested in a little experiment with the ConvNets. I gain interest in
deep-learning 2 years ago and quickly wanted to exploit the power of Deep Convolutional
Neural Network.

But first, one can estimate the ''distance'' between two images by subtracting the value for each
pixels and compute some sort of euclidean distance... However it will failed most of the
time (as for example if you slightly shift an image the distance with itself can be huge
!!!). So ''close'' images can be translate as ''similar'' shapes/motifs/textures included
in both of the images. There is of course a lot of more effective solutions such as
[pHash](http://www.phash.org/) or image-maching based on Fourier transform but I'd doubt
it will give satisfying results for a relatively small movie posters database.

This is where the power of deep learning occur as it is normally able to learn
[**invariant
features**](https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-convolutional-neural-network-able-to-learn-invariant-features). The
idea is to use ConvNet as features extractor that will map images into fixed meaningful
size vectors in which we will be able to use to compute distances between each others.

So basically, you take the output of a pre-trained ConvNet for all the images and then
compute distances between each images.

I will not bother you more with the details as I wrote a [blog post](http://iwoaf.com/finding-similar-movie-posters-with-convnet-deep-learning/) about it. (it might no
longer be exactly what I did but It was written 2 years ago).

**Cherry Picking:**

All those words to give you some cherry peak example of what the algorithm consider to be
similar:

* [Rock'n'Roll High School (1979)](http://iwoaf.com/content/images/2017/04/7135_500.jpg)

**Sofware/Library used:**

Most of the project is based on python:

* data processing: [keras](https://keras.io/), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* backend: [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), flask-restful
* frontend: html, css, [d3js](https://d3js.org/), javascript is a pain guys!
* data-storage: Postgresql

By the way the data processing needs a relatively powerful computer (~32Go of RAM and a GPU
for the ConvNet part).

The datavisualizations are hosted on a VPS from [scaleway](https://scaleway.com).

**The code:**

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/adrz/movie-posters-convnet) feel free

[https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london)

It's an online Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree offered by Goldsmiths, University of London and facilitated through Coursera.

Here is the prospectus for it and it has the curriculum:

I'm sure you get these kind of questions a lot and I've been reading around the FAQ and all but I have to say I'm still a bit confused and unable to comprehend all the information being put towards me. Right now I'm attending community college and plan on going for a bachelors degree in physics (though I've mostly only taken core classes so far). The only problem is I don't really plan on going for a graduate degree in physics, which has lead me toward the option of going for a job in software or some programming field. The general idea I've gotten from reading around is that computer science degrees don't always necessarily focus too heavy on learning up to date programming tools and such, but that the general skills you learn make it easy to transition into using those tools. So I've been pondering about whether I should just go for a computer science degree if I want to get a job in programming or software since it would help me more easily transition into learning up to date software or web development. In short, I want to go for some type of programming or software/development job, so I am wondering if getting a computer science degree would help me go into that easier than a physics to a nontrivial degree.",1545615969

ARE YOU PART OF THE SOLUTION? News: Unconfirmed TX's @ 174K, more exchanges adding SegWit, Core prioritizes SegWit GUI",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m6zd0/day_4_i_will_repost_this_guide_daily_until/,"**NOTE** Just a daily repost because original OP [/u/Bastiat](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bastiat) seems to be offline (due to holidays I guess). However, this is quite important as I see much misinformation on which exchanges use segwit or not.    
Please upvote for awareness.

**BACKGROUND**

Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make it happen. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 
___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever  purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The mempool is currently overflowing. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange

__________________________

**SELECTED TOP EXCHANGES BY SEGWIT & BATCHING STATUS**
 
There are 2 different Segwit address formats.  

* p2sh - starting with a ""3...""
* bech32 - starting ""bc1...""

Not many wallets/exchanges support bech32 yet and will claim the address is invalid if you try to send to it. bech32 (""native Segwit"") is a mildly better solution compared to p2sh.


| **Exchange**  | **Batching Status** | **Segwit (p2sh)** | **Send to bech32** |

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Transaction if the sending address is a SegWit address.

So what address can I send to safely, there is so much confusion?

- As of right now...

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

- Draw your own conclusions based on their own words:

To the guy who jizzed in the 1st floor library bathroom, learn to clean up after yourself.

I just wanted to take a shit somewhere and I opened the stall to find enough jizz to feed an entire village of Africa. Not only that, but it was all over the floor, the toilet seat cover, the walls, everywhere EXCEPT the fucking toilet bowl. Is it that hard to aim your dick at the goddamn bowl before you nut? It's like someone exploded a bottle of ranch dressing all over the place. Fuck.

And it smelled FUCKING HORRIBLE. What the fuck did you eat, six pounds of skunk carcasses? I opened that stall door and not only did I get assaulted by the sight of the brand new paint job on the walls and floor, but also by the stench, which was comparable to getting stabbed in the nostrils by a frozen and sharpened piece of dogshit --actually, I think I'd prefer the dogshit.

You put Chernobyl and Hiroshima to shame with the intensity of the nuclear catastrophe you unleashed upon this bathroom stall. I feel like being exposed to it has single handedly subtracted 7 years from my lifespan. I can feel my cells deteriorating as we speak. There are no words for the sheer emotional and mental damage you inflicted on my being. This jizz has offended not only my senses, but it has touched my very soul and brought me several steps closer to the eternal fires of Hell. Jesus Tittyfucking Christ, you broke me.

Either learn to cum in the toilet bowl or just stop fucking nutting in this Catholic institution of learning. You are an adult, PLEASE nut somewhere other than the walls and floor and save our janitors the trouble of cleaning up your radioactive baby juice. I swear to fucking God, if I ever find out who you are, I am cutting your dick off and tossing it into the fires of an active volcano in the hopes that it will never hurt another living being ever again.

2927,BGVAOMKDT6F1P494GZ5PK3TZR,helecx,Currently in Wuhan. Hopefully I’m offering a fresh perspective different from what you’re getting from the news,Coronavirus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/eu8lrl/currently_in_wuhan_hopefully_im_offering_a_fresh/,"I’m one of the millions in Wuhan right now who is affected by this. It is heartbreaking to see comments here saying how we deserve it. 

Yes. Some people are disgusting and uneducated, they eat everything that moves and have total disregard for health/safety regulations. But most people aren’t like that. Most of us are just normal folks living a normal life. We are just as angry at those exotic animal traders as you are, if not more. 

It’s CNY, and in case you’re not familiar with the Chinese culture, let me first put into perspective it’s importance. It’s like thanksgiving and Christmas combined. Historical/Traditional significance aside, for millions of people, CNY is the only time of the year where families get to reunite and have a home cooked meal together. It is more common than not for chinese people in more rural areas to go to cities to find better work opportunities. They work hard for the whole year, sending home the little money they earn to support their children and parents. Families don’t get to see each other for a whole year and reunion dinner on CNY eve is something everyone looks forward to. 

The coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year that families get to reunite. Doctors and nurses are working around the clock, many of them have not gone home in weeks; healthcare professionals across China are flying voluntarily to Wuhan to help; factory workers have resumed work due to the shortage of masks and protective suits; 3M and other companies are donating masks too; hotels across Wuhan have offered free accomodation to healthcare professionals whose home are too far away; chain convenient stores are providing free hot meals to hospitals and workers; delivery man have to give up their holidays to deliver food to families because we can’t leave our homes; construction workers are working around the clock to build new hospitals... do all these people working tireless to save lives deserve to get affected and die too??? Those selfish exotic animal traders have taken away precious family time from all these people who are literally putting their lives in danger to help others, and yet on the Internet, these unsung heroes are being lumped together with them, criticised condemned and humiliated. It’s really heartbreaking. Those people don’t deserve any of it. 

As of now, most of our fridges are still fully stocked from CNY, but what about in a week or even a couple of days when we run out of food? My parents just came back from the supermarket and many shelves are empty. Public transport have shut down completely, from today onwards vehicles unrelated to the containment of coronavirus will not be allowed on roads too, no one is allowed to leave Wuhan. So let me ask you, do all of us deserve this too? Especially during a time of supposed celebration. I’m not even a permanent resident here, I am just home for the holidays after being away for more than a year. But now I can’t leave to go back to Uni. I’m sure there are many people in similar situations as me. I hope I’m not coming off as playing the victim. I’m merely trying to tell my side of the story. And I’m so sorry the virus has now spread to other countries. I truly am very sorry. But not all Chinese are bad people. Not all are selfish and entitled and just downright disgusting human beings. I don’t think it’s fair for you to say that we all “deserve” it because of the terrible behaviours of some.",1580083912

-----------------------

A few weeks ago, I posted a thread here showing a live update on my quest to open a bank account for my Bitcoin trading business here in Australia (OP: https://redd.it/6fl0i3).

While pretty much all of these application requests were denied, one bank did respond with an application form (Albeit, the email felt a bit generic - but figured I'd give it a try none the less)

I submitted my application and everything was going great.. Until I was informed that I had failed their ID verification process and to submit it again. It was an online form I had to fill out and I thought it was strange that it didnt request my ID information, just Name, DOB, address and phone number. I thought it may have been a glitch, so submitted the form again. Still no request for ID.

Two days later, I received a phone call from this bank, stating that my ID verification had been denied, as my details had been ""red flagged"" for fraudulent behaviour, and I would have to get this fixed up before submitting again. I was told to contact ""Equifax"" to get the issue resolved and that was that.

I Immediately contacted equifax (the recent purchaser of VEDA), and asked if I could speak to someone regarding a ""rejected ID verification"". After bouncing through a few people, it came apparent that no one had any idea as to what I was talking about, and that they only dealt with Credit Reports.

So I ordered my credit report (for me personally and my business) to see if there was anything on there to be concerned about. Nothing. Just some old credit card applications from 2013, and a car loan. No ""Red Flag"", No ""Suspicions activity reports"". Nothing.

By this point I thought maybe the bank was trying to shift the blame, so they could avoid the conversation of telling me they couldnt offer me a bank account because of my business nature. But before I made the phone call to them, I figured, a quick google search wouldnt help.

Sure enough, Equifax DOES have an ID verification system called IDMatrix - and as spotted, the bank I was dealing with was one of their clients, and a bank I had been BANNED from in the past was also a client.

Now that I had a name to the face, I called Equifax bank, and requested to speak to someone from IDMatrix, regarding some verification issues. The closest I got was speaking to someone from their sales team, who put me through to the credit report department, who put me through to ""customer service"", who put me back through to the IDMatrix sales department, who were then closed.

Getting no luck with the phone calls, I decided to draft up an email to IDMatrix, and sent another email to the bank, requesting they provide proof of this ID rejection, so I could send it onto IDMatrix, in case they try to stone wall me with ""We have no idea what youre talking about"" answers again.

When I was going through the IDMatrix website earlier, I noticed that they provided their services to non financial businesses as well (Such as a large Electricity and Gas Provider here in Australia). Out of curiosity, I started the application process to apply for a new electricity connection to my house, to see if the result would be any different to what the bank got. A few tick boxes later, and sure enough, I was not eligible for an electricity connection with them!

I was shocked. Dealing with bank bans was one thing, but dealing with the rejection from a basic household utilities company was another. What significance does my business activity have to a utilities provider? I'm sure they have no issue with providing electricity to hydroponic set ups, or a gas connection to a meth lab? At least ive never heard of electricity or gas being cut for that reason. I would assume they couldnt give two stuffs what they do in their spare time. But a Bitcoin Trader? Thats some risky business. (Yes I am aware this isnt the Utilities company's fault - rather IDMatrix's, just using the hypothetical for comparison).

To wrap this up, I have emailed my solicitor to get advice on the matter, and I'm not ""banking"" on much to receive any response from the bank in question or Equifax. But thanks for the vent reddit. Appreciate it.",1498149016

If a 32-bit CPU can only process 4,294,967,296 bytes of RAM at a time, does it make sense to say that since every 8 bits equal 1 byte of memory then every single 32-bit memory-address equals 4 bytes of memory since 32 divided by 8=4?

(i.e. 00000000(1B)00000000(1B)00000000(1B)00000000(1B) 32-bit-memory-address)

Moreover, if this is true then the total amount of RAM addresses in a 32-bit system would be 1,073,741,824

Since **4,294,967,296** divided by **4** equals **1,073,741,824**

And my conclusion would be that a 32-bit system can access **1,073,741,824** RAM addresses at a time, each address amounting to 4 bytes of memory.

And if this isn't true, **how many 32-bit memory addresses are there** and **how much RAM capacity does each one take up?**

I have previously coded in Java. This year at university, I had JavaScript in Computer which is my subsidiary subject. Most of my classmates referred to it as 'Java' and it bothered me a lot. I tired explaining the difference many times but they wouldn't stop. They hadn't done Java at all previously but still it wasn't technically correct to call it JavaScript​ as Java. The worst part is that I tried to clear this one of my friend and she said that nobody cares what it is called. 


Besides this, everyone's afraid of JavaScript and thinks that it's difficult. We also have HTML in our curriculum and everyone prefers it. I'm the only one who would gladly take JavaScript over HTML anyday. I know both the languages well but I'm more proficient in JavaScript. I was really frustrated when in our final practical exam, there was no question from JavaScript; only from HTML. 


All this has really made me think a lot about continuing with computer as my minor next year. I have to drop one; and it's either this or physics. I'm really interested in computer languages but my classmates make it really hard. It's not fun when I'm surrounded by a bunch of technically challenged people. The worst part is that they get their way with the teacher. They even managed to cut out the CSS practicals (another thing that I really like and am good at). 


Maybe I'm overreacting. The thing is that I do want to continue with these languages but not as a part of my course. There must be alternatives; I could use some suggestions.

I'm gonna try to keep this short because I want to vent but not rant. 

All I'm gonna say is, I really enjoy the major. I spent three years in college doing electives trying to figure out what I want to do and I love comp Sci. But I haven't programmed until the semester before I got into the major and took all my easy, least time consuming courses already.  I am also generally a slow learner, but I do my time and I do my best. My logic is it doesn't matter how you do as long as you enjoy it and do your best, and yes, I am on the C-B- side if the spectrum for most courses except for a few. 

But lately, these elitest, those who are the fastest learners, or have experience, or just gets it better than I do,  make me feel like i shouldnt be here even though I think i deserve to be here because I worked to be here and that's why I got here. I spent my time looking for what I enjoy most and this is it. Even if a lot of these elitest who don't say it to me, but rather those who might complain and/or are in the same position as me (but obviously more vocal about it), the responses they get tend to make me feel crummy and depressed.

However I've been in an internship and been told I'm doing great because I do the time needed and work outside of work, so it's reassuring but I just get bothered by the elitism that tell other students they shouldn't be in the major... ",1509133964

**[A brief taste of what we're doing](https://twitter.com/Sentdex/status/854394799104962561)**

..or check out the latest video in the series: **[a more interesting self-driving AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWJZ4w0HKz8)**, especially near the end. 

This is by no means a serious look into self-driving vehicles, it's just for fun, and so far the latest project has been to make a motorcycle that speeds through traffic, attempting to stay on the road and evading all the other slow drivers. 

We do all of this with basic(ish...) tools and concepts. We're reading the screen by taking screenshots with pywin32, seeing about 20 FPS with the neural network, sending keys with direct input, and then doing some analysis with OpenCV, otherwise also training with a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

The goal of the series is more to show you how you can take just about whatever game you want, mapping the screen to inputs, training a neural network, and then letting the network play the game. 

It's an ongoing project, and is also **[open-source](https://github.com/sentdex/pygta5/)**

Here's a link to the **[self-driving tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/)**, which starts at the beginning.

""Earlier this year, I wrote to a dozen or so key Senators and Congressmen concerning the illegality of Bitcoin in the United States.

I originally wrote to these people to have an opportunity to testify in front of Congress against Bitcoin's use in the US as a currency. Bitcoin is only one of a dozen or so illegal currencies, but Bitcoin seems to be the main one to battle against.

I was wondering if there are any other frameworks you find useful that we missed and should add to the list. I’m copying the entire list here (each entry also has some sample code, but I’m excluding that). Please let me know if you think we should add any framework. 

(and, if you’d like to check out the full article, you can find it here: [A Beginner’s Introduction to Python Web Frameworks](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/09/27/beginners-introduction-python-frameworks/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=2019-08-jd))

## Django

**The most popular Python framework is Django, hands down.** Django’s trademark is that it offers all the tools you need to build a web application within a single package, from low- to high-end.

Django applications are based on a design pattern similar to MVC, the so-called MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern. Models are defined using the Django ORM, while SQL databases are mainly used as storage.

Django has a built-in admin panel, allowing for easy management of the database content. With minimal configuration, this panel is generated automatically based on the defined models.

Views can include both functions and classes, and the assignment of URLs to views is done in one location (the urls.py file), so that after reviewing that single file you can learn which URLs are supported. Templates are created using a fairly simple Django Templates system.

Django is praised for strong community support and detailed documentation describing the functionality of the framework. This documentation coupled with getting a comprehensive environment after the installation makes the entry threshold rather low. Once you go through [the official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/), you’ll be able to do most of the things required to build an application.

**Unfortunately, Django’s monolithism also has its drawbacks.** It is difficult, though not impossible, to replace one of the built-in elements with another implementation. For example, using some other ORM (like SQLAlchemy) requires abandoning or completely rebuilding such items as the admin panel, authorization, session handling, or generating forms.

Because Django is complete but inflexible, it is suitable for standard applications (i.e. the vast majority of software projects). However, if you need to implement some unconventional design, it leads to struggling with the framework, rather than pleasant programming.

## Flask

Flask is considered a microframework. It comes with basic functionality, while also allowing for easy expansion. Therefore, **Flask works more as the glue that allows you to join libraries with each other.**

For example, “pure Flask” does not provide support for any storage, yet there are many different implementations that you can install and use interchangeably for that purpose (such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-MongoAlchemy, and Flask-Redis). Similarly, the basic template system is Jinja2, but you can use a replacement (like Mako).

The motto of this framework is “one drop at a time,” and this is reflected in its comprehensive documentation. The knowledge of how to build an application is acquired in portions here; after reading a few paragraphs, you will be able to perform basic tasks.

You don’t have to know the more advanced stuff right away—you’ll learn it once you actually need it. Thanks to this, students of Flask can gather knowledge smoothly and avoid boredom, making Flask suitable for learning.

**A large number of Flask extensions, unfortunately, are not supported as well as the framework itself.** It happens quite often that the plug-ins are no longer being developed or their documentation is outdated. In cases like these, you need to spend some time googling a replacement that offers similar functionality and is still actively supported.

When building your application with packages from different authors, you might have to put quite a bit of sweat into integrating them with each other. You will rarely find ready-made instructions on how to do this in the plug-ins’ documentation, but in such situations the Flask community and websites such as Stack Overflow should be of help.

## Pyramid

Pyramid, the third noteworthy Python web framework, is rooted in two other products that are no longer developed: Pylons and repoze.bfg. **The legacy left by its predecessors caused Pyramid to evolve into a very mature and stable project.**

The philosophies of Pyramid and Django differ substantially, even though both were released in the same year (2005). Unlike Django, Pyramid is trivial to customize, allowing you to create features in ways that the authors of the framework themselves hadn’t foreseen. It does not force the programmer to use framework’s idioms; it’s meant to be a solid scaffolding for complex or highly non-standard projects.

Pyramid strives to be persistence-agnostic. While there is no bundled database access module, a common practice is to combine Pyramid with the powerful, mature SQLAlchemy ORM. Of course, that’s only the most popular way to go. Programmers are free to choose whatever practices suit them best, such as using the peewee ORM, writing raw SQL queries, or integrating with a NoSQL database, just to name a few.

All options are open, though this approach requires a bit of experience to smoothly add the desired persistence mechanisms to the project. The same goes for other components, such as templating.

Openness and freedom are what Pyramid is all about. Modules bundled with it relate to the web layer only and users are encouraged to freely pick third-party packages that will support other aspects of their projects.

**However, this model causes a noticeable overhead at the beginning of any new project,**because you have to spend some time choosing and integrating the tools your team is comfortable with. Still, once you put the effort into making additional decisions during the early stages of the work, you are rewarded with a setup that makes it easy and comfortable to start a new project and develop it further.

Pyramid is a self-proclaimed “start small, finish big, stay finished framework.” This makes it an appropriate tool for experienced developers who are not afraid of playing the long game and working extra hard in the beginning, without shipping a single feature within the first few days. Less experienced programmers may feel a bit intimidated.

## web2py

Created in 2007, web2py is a framework originally designed as a teaching tool for students, so the main concern for its authors was ease of development and deployment.

Web2py is strongly inspired by Django and Ruby on Rails, sharing the idea of **convention over configuration. In other words, web2py provides many** ***sensible defaults*** **that allow developers to get off the ground quickly.**

This approach also means there are a lot of goodies bundled with web2py. You will find everything you’d expect from a web framework in it, including a built-in server, HTML-generating helpers, forms, validators, and many more—nothing unusual thus far, one could argue. Support for multiple database engines is neat, though it’s a pretty common asset among current web frameworks.

However, some other bundled features may surprise you, since they are not present in other frameworks:

* helpers for creating [JavaScript](https://stxnext.com/services/javascript-development/)\-enabled sites with jQuery and Ajax;
* scheduler and cron;
* 2-factor authentication helpers;
* text message sender;
* an event-ticketing system, allowing for automatic assignment of problems that have occurred in the production environment to developers.

The framework proudly claims to be a full-stack solution, providing everything you could ever need.

Web2py has extensive documentation available online. It guides newcomers step by step, starting with a short introduction to the Python language. The introduction is seamlessly linked with the rest of the manual, demonstrating different aspects of web2py in a friendly manner, with lots of code snippets and screenshots.

**Despite all its competitive advantages, web2py’s community is significantly smaller than Django’s, or even Pyramid’s.** Fewer developers using it means your chances of getting help and support are lower. The official mailing list is mostly inactive.

Additionally—and unfortunately—web2py is not compatible with Python 3 at the moment. This state of things puts the framework’s prospects into question, as support for Python 2 ends in 2020. This issue is being addressed on the project’s github. [Here](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/issues/1353) is where you can track the progress.

## Sanic

**Sanic differs considerably from the aforementioned frameworks because unlike them, it is based on asyncio**—Python’s toolbox for asynchronous programming, bundled with the standard library starting from version 3.4.

In order to develop projects based on Sanic, you have to grasp the ideas behind asyncio first. This involves a lot of theoretical knowledge about coroutines, concurrent programming caveats, and careful reasoning about the data flow in the application.

Once you get your head around Sanic/asyncio and applies the framework to an appropriate problem, the effort pays off. Sanic is especially useful when it comes to handling long-living connections, such as websockets. If your project requires support for websockets or making a lot of long-lasting external API calls, Sanic is a great choice.

Another use case of Sanic is writing a “glue-web application” that can serve as a mediator between two subsystems with incompatible APIs. Note that it requires at least Python 3.5, though.

The framework is meant to be very fast. One of its dependencies is [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop)—an alternative, drop-in replacement for asyncio’s not-so-good built-in event loop. Uvloop is a wrapper around libuv, the same engine that powers Node.js. According to the uvloop documentation, this makes asyncio work 2–4 times faster.

**In terms of “what’s in the box,” Sanic doesn’t offer as much as other frameworks.** It is a microframework, just like Flask. Apart from routing and other basic web-related goodies like utilities for handling cookies and streaming responses, there’s not much inside. Sanic imitates Flask, for instance by sharing the concept of Blueprints—tiny sub-applications that allow developers to split and organize their code in bigger applications.

Sanic also won’t be a good choice for simple CRUD applications that only perform basic database operations. It would just make them more complicated with no visible benefit.

## Japronto

Have you ever imagined handling 1,000,000 requests per second with Python?

It seems unreal, since Python isn’t the fastest programming language out there. But when a brilliant move was made to add asyncio to the standard library, it opened up countless possibilities.

Japronto is a microframework that leverages some of them. As a result, **this Python framework was able to cross the magical barrier of 1 million requests handled per second.**

You may still be at a loss as to how that is possible, exactly.

It all comes down to 2 aces up Japronto’s sleeve: uvloop and PicoHTTPParser. Uvloop is an asyncio backend based on libuv, while PicoHTTPParser is a lightweight HTTP headers parser written in C. All core components of the framework are also implemented in C. A wide variety of low-level optimizations and tricks are used to tweak performance.

Japronto is designed for special tasks that could not be accomplished with bloated mainstream frameworks. It is a perfect fit for problems where every nanosecond counts. Knowledgeable developers, obsessed with optimization, will reap all of its possible benefits.

Additionally, Japronto is meant to provide a solid foundation for microservices using REST APIs with minimal overhead. In other words, there’s not much in the box. Developers only need to set up routing and decide which routes should use synchronous or asynchronous handlers.

It might seem counterintuitive, but if a request can be handled in a synchronous way, you shouldn’t try to do it asynchronously, as the overhead of switching between coroutines will limit performance.

**What is quite unfortunate is that Japronto is not being actively developed.** On the other hand, the project is licensed under MIT, and the author claims he is willing to accept any contributions. Like Sanic, the framework is meant to work with Python 3.5+ versions.

## aiohttp

Aiohttp is another library based on asyncio, the modern Python toolkit for writing asynchronous code. **Not meant to be a framework in a strict sense, aiohttp is more of a toolbox, supplementing the async arsenal with everything related to HTTP.**

This means aiohttp is helpful not only for writing server applications, but also to clients. Both will benefit from asyncio’s goodies, most of all the ability to handle thousands of connections at the same time, provided the majority of operations involves I/O calls.

Such powerful clients are great when you have to issue many API calls at once, for example for scraping web pages. Without asyncio, you would have to use threading or multiprocessing, which are harder to get right and require much more memory.

Apart from building standalone applications, aiohttp’s clients are a great supplement to any asyncio-based application that needs to issue non-blocking HTTP calls. The same is true for websockets. Since they are part of the HTTP specification, you can connect to websocket servers and easily exchange messages with them.

When it comes to servers, aiohttp gives you everything you can expect from a microframework. The features available out-of-the-box include routing, middleware, and signals. It may seem like it’s very little, but it will suffice for a web server.

“What about the remaining functionalities?” you may ask.

As far as those are concerned, you can build the rest of the functionalities using one or many asyncio-compatible libraries. You will find plenty of them using sources [like this one](https://github.com/timofurrer/awesome-asyncio).

Aiohttp is built with testing in mind. Developers who want to test an aiohttp-based application will find it extremely easy, especially with the aid of pytest.

Even though aiohttp offers satisfactory performance by default, there are a few low-hanging fruits you can pick. For example, you can install additional libraries: cchardet and aiodns. Aiohttp will detect them automatically. You can also utilize the same uvloop that powers Sanic.

Last but not least: **one definite advantage of aiohttp is that it is being actively maintained and developed.** Choosing aiohttp when you build your next application will certainly be a good call.

## Twisted

With Twisted, Python developers were able to do async programming long before it was cool. Twisted is one of the oldest and most mature Python projects around.

Originally released in 2002, Twisted predates even PEP8, so the code of the project does not follow the famous code style guide recommendations. Admittedly, this may somewhat discourage people from using it these days.

Twisted’s heart is an event-driven networking engine called reactor. It is used for scheduling and calling user-defined callbacks.

In the beginning, developers had to use explicit callbacks by defining functions and passing them around separately for cases when an operation succeeded and when it failed.

Although this technique was compelling, it could also lead to what we know from early JavaScript: callback hell. In other words, the resultant code was tough to read and analyze.

**At some point, Twisted introduced inlineCallbacks—the notation for writing asynchronous code that was as simple to read as regular, synchronous code.** This solution played very well with Python’s syntax and greatly influenced modern async toolkit from the standard library, asyncio.

The greatest advantage of this framework is that although Twisted itself is just an engine with few bundled extensions, there are many additional extensions available to expand its functionality. They allow for both low-level network programming (TCP/USP) and high, application-level work (HTTP, IMAP, SHH, etc).

**This makes Twisted a perfect choice for writing specialized services; however, it is not a good candidate for regular web applications.** Developers would have to write a lot of things on their own to get the functionality they take for granted with Django.

Twisted is being actively maintained. There is an undergoing effort to migrate all of its code to be compatible with Python 3. The core functionality was rewritten some time ago, but many third-party modules are still incompatible with newer versions of the interpreter.

This may raise some concerns whether Twisted is the best choice for new projects. On the other hand, though, it is more mature than some asyncio-based solutions. Also, Twisted has been around for quite some time now, which means it will undoubtedly be maintained at least for a good while.

## Falcon

Falcon is another microframework on our list. The goal of the Falcon project is to create a minimalist foundation for building web apps where the slightest overhead matters.

Authors of the framework claim it is a **bare-metal, bloat-free toolkit for building very fast backend code and microservices.** Plus, it is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

A big advantage of Falcon is that it is indeed very fast. Benchmarks published on its website show an incredible advantage over mainstream solutions like Django or Flask.

The downside, though, is that **Falcon offers very little to start with.** There’s routing, middlewares, hooks—and that’s basically everything. There are no extras: no validation, no authentication, etc. It is up to the developer to extend functionality as needed.

Falcon assumes it will be used for building REST APIs that talk JSON. If that is the case, you really need literally zero configuration. You can just sit down and code.

This microframework might be an exciting proposition for implementing highly-customized services that demand the highest performance possible. Falcon is an excellent choice when you don’t want or can’t invest in asyncio-based solutions.

If you’re thinking, “Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one,” you should definitely consider Falcon.

## API Star

API Star is the new kid on the block. It is yet another microframework, but this one is compatible with Python 3 only. Which is not surprising, because it leverages type hints introduced in Python 3.5.

**API Star uses type hints as a notation for building validation schemata in a concise, declarative way.** Such a schema (called a “Type” in the framework’s terminology) can then be bound to request a handling function.

Additionally, API Star features automatically generated API docs. They are compatible with OpenAPI 3. Such docs can facilitate communication between API authors and its consumers, i.e. frontend developers. If you use the Types we’ve mentioned, they are included in the API docs.

Another outstanding feature is the dependency injection mechanism. It appears to be an alternative to middlewares, but smarter and much more powerful.

For example, you can write a so-called Component that will provide our views with a currently authenticated User. On the view level, you have to explicitly state that it will require a User instance.

The rest happens behind the scenes. API Star resolves which Components have to be executed to finally run our view with all the required information.

The advantage that automatic dependency injection has over regular middlewares is that Components do not cause any overhead for the views where they are not used.

Last but not least, API Star can also be run atop asyncio in a more traditional, synchronous, WSGI-compliant way. **This makes it probably the only popular framework in the Python world capable of doing that.**

The rest of the goodies bundled with API Star are pretty standard: optional support for templating with jinja2, routing, and event hooks.

All in all, API Star looks extremely promising. At the time of writing, it has over 4,500 stars in its GitHub repository. The repository already has a few dozen contributors, and pull requests are merged daily. Many of us at STX Next are keeping our fingers crossed for this project!

## Other Python web development frameworks

There are many more Python web frameworks out there you might find interesting and useful. Each of them focuses on a different issue, was built for distinct tasks, or has a particular history.

The first that comes to mind is **Zope2,** one of the oldest frameworks, still used mainly as part of the Plone CMS. **Zope3** (later renamed BlueBream) was created as Zope2’s successor. The framework was supposed to allow for easier creation of large applications, but hasn’t won too much popularity, mainly because of the need to master fairly complex concepts (e.g. Zope Component Architecture) very early in the learning process.

Also noteworthy is the **Google App Engine,** which allows you to run applications written in Python, among others. This platform lets you create applications in any framework compatible with WSGI. The SDK for the App Engine includes a simple framework called webapp2, and this exact approach is often used in web applications adapted to this environment.

Another interesting example is **Tornado,** developed by FriendFeed and made available by Facebook. This framework includes libraries supporting asynchronicity, so you can build applications that support multiple simultaneous connections (like long polling or WebSocket).

Other libraries similar to Tornado include **Pulsar** (async) and **Gevent** (greenlet). These libraries allow you to build any network applications (multiplayer games and chat rooms, for example). They also perform well at handling HTTP requests.

Developing applications using these frameworks and libraries is more difficult and requires you to explore some harder-to-grasp concepts. We recommend getting to them later on, as you venture deeper into the wonderful world of Python.

**Edit.**

Thanks for all your suggestions and support.

I've received news from localbitcoins, I will update this once the authorities get in touch and decide course of action.

&#x200B;

In may 2015  [/BTC-OTC/](https://localbitcoins.com/p/BTC-OTC/)  scammed me and other 6 persons using bank transfer chargeback which led to my bank account being closed and all my funds frozen for 45 days.  At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.

I  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK

Localbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)

Since then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months

When contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)

When contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.

I emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.

Police official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)

National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.

After 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)

I knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.

Almost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.

Reason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.

Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at €10.000 to  €15.000 for civil proceedings,

Finnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court

If you are a victim of this or you can help please get in touch.",1534806566

Should i pick frontend vs backend?,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8vk8bl/2nd_year_computer_science_student_in_need_of/,"Background: I'm a second year CS student graduating next year. Currently done intro to Java, MYSQL,  python/django (btw how amazing is django?!). Also bit of web design with javascript,html and css. 

I've enjoyed both. And now i really want to learn js frameworks for personal projects but also want to continue with J2EE java OOP.

My dilemma #1: In order to get ready for the marketplace i need to pick a specialization i.e. backend (java, spring, hibernate) or front end (javascript/react/angular, html, css). The problem is I want to be a full stack ideally but also realize its smarter to pick one stack initially and become competent to be job ready (1.5 year until graduation). . 

Question 1. Is it realistic to focus on becoming a full stack as i graduate (1.5years left)? Or pick one path and be REALLY good at it. Im an average student and know it will take time/energy to be good at any given path.

My dilemma #2: imposter sydrone. Yup, i don't have real workplace experience atm so i don't  know if I'm good enough. Assignments are great but not the same as working on real projects with colleagues and deadlines where you actually have to know your department.

therefore i think doing front end would be easy vs backend to get started? Even though i really enjoy OOP java a lot too

Any insight from your experience for new graduate would be so helpful! (I've been over thinking too much)

As the years went by, the total number of stored images seems to grow every time we travel and even though we organize our images, sometimes it’s hard to recall when (exactly which year and month) we visited a specific place. Thinking about it, I realized that nowadays most photos are captured on smartphones or digital cameras that come equipped with GPS and automatically geotag each photo with GPS coordinates, as well as date and time of each image capture.

That said, I wrote a Python GUI App (<300 lines of code) that you can point to a directory where your photos are stored and the script will do the rest. It'll scan and extract the Exif information from all your images and convert the gathered EXIF information into:

* **Excel Travel Log** \- List of locations sorted by month/year
* **Google Map** \- This is a visual representation of all our travels. Google Map pins show the detail date and time of our visit

Following are some screenshots from the **PythonPhoto2Location** app, outlining the four steps it takes to get from a collection of photos to an Excel file and Google Maps:

I feel burned out from my courses, internships, and student jobs in the past 2 years and have no motivation to do anything related to CS at the moment. I feel as if all my inspiration and energy have been sucked out of me.

I have a paid offer to do my thesis at a research institute in my city, but I am inclined to decline the offer due to lack of interest and mental exhaustion. I am also more interested in NLP, which is unavailable at my university. Since I live in a small city, there are not many opportunities for a paid thesis and I am afraid that I would be making a mistake turning down the offer. I am also scared to move to another city for my thesis due to a negative experience earlier this year.

Goodbye Coinbase.,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7py0gk/i_just_transferred_out_my_funds_i_can_no_longer/,"I really can not stand how they are handling Bitcoin. It is clear they do not want a truly decentralized system to flourish, despite what their framework says. 

I am not a fan of secret agendas and greedy hands. It is possible to make money and be respectable, but Coinbase has chosen a different path. 

It saddens me because Coinbase was my entry point into crypto, and now I feel they've aligned themselves against what the entire system should stand for. 

Goodbye Coinbase. For your sake, I hope you can redeem yourself. But for now, you are losing a customer for a company with standards and values that actually reflect in their actions.

Edit: For anyone wanting to do the same. https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2063066-how-can-i-close-my-account-

A Few reasons: The way they handled the release of Bcash [(Roger Ver defended the Insider Trading)](https://www.ccn.com/insider-trading-non-crime-roger-ver-bites-back-gdax-re-opens-bitcoin-cash-trading/), The CEO Brian Armstrong is [clearly against Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/Tom_Horvath/status/949207156338946048), They have yet to implement segwit in a timely manner.  It is clear to me they would like to make money over sticking to their standards and values. As stated above, it is possible to do both. 

Another: [Spamming the network](http://bitcoinist.com/mempool-coinbase-spamming-bitcoin/)

Edit: While I have some attention. Please consider donating to Coin Center. They are a non profit focused on educating governments about cryptocurrencies. I think they do good work. https://coincenter.org/donate",1515805971

Long story, won't get into it, but basically I've been on the CS track while working full time in an unrelated job for the past four years. There's been stops and starts, and the consequence is that even though I only have 6 credits left, I haven't actually done much coding at all in a few years now.

I'm pretty confident that I'm a good worker, a good communicator and a good learner but I feel like if I was put on the spot today in an interview I would have a really hard time looking like I've learned anything or can do anything related to CS. Because of the pressures of working and going to school while dealing with life generally, I have basically no portfolio of things I've coded, at least since very basic exercises way back when. The divide between what my piece of paper implies I know and what I feel like I actually know seems really wide.

Part of it feels like imposters syndrome, but I'm also convinced part of this anxiety is based in a real decay of my knowledge due to the non traditional nature of my schooling.

So the basic question is: what are the fundamentals I need to be able to demonstrate for an entry level position? Knowledge of data structures? Do I *have* to have a portfolio or github for an entry level position? I'm certainly not looking to get into highly competitive positions at one of the more prestigious companies in Seattle or the Bay, and I definitely plan to leverage what I am confident about, but certainly I'm sure there's fundamentals I need to not get laughed out of the door anywhere.",1539841339

Working on programming excercises and projects takes me quite a lot of time, not necessarily because I find them hard but because I want to make sure that I'm doing the best that I can and that I'm really understanding what's going on (otherwise I would feel like something is missing or ""it's not as good as I would like it to be/think it should be""). 

Because of this I'm left with little time to do any actual studying and usually I'm just too tired or ""bored"" to even start or I can't find the right focus/mental state to approach the matter in an effective way; it's kinda like I'm always mentally or physically tired or there's some external factor or something I keep thinking about that provides me with distractions that make me interrupt often what I'm trying to do.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  **Difference between a Value Type and a Reference Type**

* Value type: hold the data within its own memory allocation. Stored in the stack.
* Value types can be created at compile time and stored in stack memory.
* Value type: if assigned to another variable, the value is copied directly and both variables work independently.
* Reference type:  contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the real data. Stored in the heap.
* Reference types are used by a reference which holds a reference (address) to the object itself. 
* Reference type: assigning a reference variable to another doesn't copy the data, but instead creates a second copy of the reference, which refers to the same location in the heap as the original value.
* reference type examples: Classes, Objects, Arrays, Indexers, Interfaces

**What is an Interface?**

* an interface is a specification for a set of class members, not an implementation. 
* an Interface is a reference type and it contains only abstract members such as Events, Methods, Properties etc. 
* you can think of an interface as an abstract class that contains only pure virtual functions. This implementation of the methods is done in the class that implements the interface.

 Difference between an Interface and a Class

* A class is a full body entity with members, methods along their definition and implementation.
* An Interface is just a set of definitions that you must implement in your Class inheriting that Interface.

 Multiple inheritance in .Net

* .Net does not support multiple inheritance. This is why Microsoft introduced Interfaces - a solution for multiple inheritance.
* .Net allows you to have a single inheritance, but you are free to implement as many interfaces as you wish.

**Static Keyword**

* Static classes and class members are used to create data and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the Class. The keyword static can be applied to the classes, field, method, properties, operator, event, and constructors.
* they cant be inherited and these classes are sealed by default. Normally it is used to group related static methods in class.
* the advantage of static keyword is that it will make your code a bit faster since no object creation is involved. 

**Jagged Array**

* An array which has elements of type array is called jagged array. The elements cam be of different dimensions and sizes.
* AKA an array of arrays

**Namespaces**

* namespaces are containers for the classes. 
* Used for grouping the related classes in C#.
* uses the ""Using"" keyword.

**Polymorphism**

* provides the ability to a class to have multiple implementations with the same name.
* two types: static (compile time) and dynamic (runtime)
* method overloading is an example of static polymorphism. Overloading is the concept in which method names are the same with a different set of parameters.
* method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism.
* method overriding can be done using inheritance. With method overriding it is possible for the base class and derived class to have the same method

**Inheritance**

* Inheritance is a concept in which you define a parent class and child classes.
* the child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class, but at the same time, they can also modify the behavior of the methods if required. the child class can also define methods of its own if it needs to.

**Encapsulation**

* a process of binding the data members and member functions into a single unit. In c#, a Class is the real time example for encapsulation because it will combine a various type of data members and member functions into a single unit.
* Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. 

**Abstract Classes**

* Abstraction is the process to hide the internal details and showing only the functionality.
* The abstract modifier indicates the incomplete implementation. 
* the keyword abstract is used before the class or method to declare the class or method to abstract.
* an abstract CLASS is never intended to be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier *abstract* in the class definition.
* abstract classes cannot support multiple inheritance.
* cant be static.
* classes marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes

**Front End Best Practices**

* indentation
* semantic elements: elements with tags that clearly deifne the content included for both the dev and the web browser.
* class and ID names: using both class and ID names are practical and relevant.
* CSS reset: resets html elements to a consistent baseline
* avoid inline style CSS
* when to use inline style: HTML email, content management system content (wordPress, etc.), Dynamic content (HTML created or altered by JavaScript), older websites.
* popular javascript frameworks: Angular, React, jQuery, Vue.js
* naming variables: always use variable names that make sense. Use camelCase.
* Comments are very important
* Design for all Browsers and Devices: Responsive Web Design

**Back End Best Practices**

*  Name things well: intelligent names, descriptive, tells us what the solution is
* use properties, not public variables:  there will be intences where you wont be able to use a public variable and will have to use a public property
* methods should do one thing: separation of concern
* camelCase
* keep it simple
* concat strings using $"""" (uses less memory space)
* avoid global variables: use app.config for data. uses less memory and can be changed at runtime
* Use public modifier only when necessary: public method can be seen by other classes outside of its own class. Private modifier : can only be seen in that class. 

**Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index**

* Indexing is a procedure that returns your requested data faster from the defined table. Without indexing, the SQL Server has to scan the whole table for your data. By indexing, SQL server does the exact same thing when you search for context in a book  by checking the index page.
* Clustered index : the type of indexing that established a physical sorting order of rows. Defining a column as a primary key makes that column the clustered the Clustered Index of that table.
* Non-Clustered : an index structure separate from the data stored in a table that reorders one or more selected columns. The non-clustered index is created to improve the performance of frequently used queries not covered by clustered indexes. 
* The differences:
   * In a table there can be only one clustered index or one or more than one non clustered index
   * In a clustered index there is no separate index.
   * In a non-clustered index there is a separate index storage for the index.
   * Clustered is slower than non-clustered.

**http Protocols**

* hyper text transfer protocol
* the underlying protocol used by the internet that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.

**Difference between http and HTML**

* http is a protocol
* HTML (hypertext markup language) is a language.

**Dependency Injection**

* DI is a design pattern that allows us to develop loosely-coupled code.
* The intent of DI is to make code maintainable.
* DI helps to reduce the tight coupling among software components.
* DI reduced the hard-coded dependencies among your classes by injecting those dependencies at runtime instead of design time.

**Entity Framework**

* EF is the framework ORM (object-relational mapping) that Microsoft makes available as part of the .Net development. 
* Its purpose is to abstract the ties to a relational database, in such a way that the dev can relate to the database entity as to a set of object and then to classes in addition to their properties. 

**MVC**

* Model View Controller is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representation of information from the way that information is presented to or accepted from the user.
* used to develop web applications
* Model = application core (database records etc); View = the display that the user sees; Controller = manipulated the data gathered by the model.
* Advantages:
   * Separation of Concerns.
   * Multiple view support,
   * Change accommodation ( because the model does not depend on the views, adding new types of views to the system generally does not affect the model.
   * More Control
* [https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/puranindia/ASP-NET-MVC-Interview-Questions/](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/puranindia/ASP-NET-MVC-Interview-Questions/)

**SQL Stored Procedures**

* prepared SQL code that you can save, so that the code can be resued over and over again.
* you can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

**Stack vs Heap**

* Stack = static memory
* Heap = dynamic memory
* The stack is more or less responsible for keeping track of whats executing in our code.
* The Heap is more or less responsible for keeping track of our objects;
* the stack is thought of like a stack of boxes and we can only access whats on the top of the stack and then throw it away.
* anything can be accessed from the heap at any time.",1565228677

I'm very interested in new instruments and midi controllers coming out from companies like [Roli](https://roli.com/products/seaboard/grand-stage), [Artiphon](https://artiphonstore.com/products/artiphon-instrument-1-black?_ga=2.148829111.1872596797.1514001925-1132988955.1514001925), and [Teenage Engineering](https://www.teenageengineering.com/products/op-1).

I'd love to eventually be a part of a team that develops and creates instruments or midi controllers like these, and I think it'd be great to put my handiness and craftiness to use while designing something that feels new and original for musicians and producers. 

That said, I'm not sure of the direction I need to take to actually get involved in this relatively niche field. Are there specific languages typically used for synths/midi instruments, or does it depend on the company and/or what works best for the specific project? Is this a field that I should take some design classes for? It would coding and a design portfolio be good enough in most cases?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1514101578

Hey guys, grumpy mod here.

We've been seeing a lot of ""What kind of laptop should I get?"" posts, which kind of deviate from the topic of a computer science subredd--

>**But it's a computer!**

That's correct, but this is a specific subset of a vast field. There are many people in a better subreddit for the job, ready to point you to a nice laptop for school that will help you with a bit of light gaming on the side.

So for now, please direct all such posts related to laptop suggestions to /r/SuggestALaptop, and let's keep this subreddit related to programming and other such software-related things.

Thanks y'all!",1531217470

In defense of optimism
Yesterday, I woke to a flurry of activity on Twitter. A prominent member of the bitcoin community had decided to a message to me that many perceived as critical. The tweet pointed out that had I managed my money better I would be wealthy and wouldn't need the support of patrons.
It was in response to a message I posted on Twitter a week earlier, to once again dispel the impression that I am a bitcoin millionaire. It is hard for many to accept that someone who has been involved since 2012 has not amassed a great fortune in bitcoin. The truth, however, is that due to circumstances and some poor choices I made, I was not able to benefit as much from the rise of bitcoin as some others have.

At the end of 2012, when I heard about bitcoin, I had been working as a freelance consultant for about a year after burning out of my previous work as a partner in a research firm. I had a modest retirement fund, a small amount of credit card debt and enough income to make ends meet. I was really in limbo, looking for the next opportunity. Bitcoin arrived into my awareness and slapped me in the face. You've all heard my story of tumbling down the rabbit hall, absolutely consumed by awe.

What is not quite obvious is that my obsession also drove me to abandon my consulting work and put all my attention into bitcoin. I worked as hard as I have ever worked, focusing full time on this technology. During this time, I was unable to find any way of making a living through bitcoin. I traveled to speak at conferences (which didn't even cover expenses), I consulted with startups (which couldn't pay me), I wrote articles etc. To support my ""habit"", I dipped into my savings. I cut back on my expenses as much as I could and started ravaging my savings. By mid-2013 I was forced to start liquidating my retirement funds. In my early 40's, I was undoing a lifetime of savings, in a way most people would consider irresponsible. While doing so, I incurred penalty taxes for early withdrawal. Then, I went into credit card debt. By the end of 2013 I was ""worse than broke"": going into debt at an alarming rate.

Finally, in 2014 I started making a bit of income. I was so deep in debt that I continued to live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to chip away at my debt. It was going to be a long two years before I finally became debt free at the end of 2016.

I won't complain about the lost opportunity. I am extremely fortunate to be able to live debt free, doing my dream job in a field I absolutely love.

Yesterday, while reading the tweet that criticized me for my poor choices, I felt sick to my stomach. It forced me to confront and relive every choice I made and all the missed opportunities. You see, the critical tweet contained a big grain of truth. I could've become wealthy. If only I hadn't sold. If only I hadn't given away hundreds of bitcoin to complete strangers. If only I had reduced my expenses more. If only I had made smarter choices. If only...

Working in bitcoin is an endless struggle against cynicism, negativity, regret. Throughout the last 5 years I have always tried to maintain an optimistic and positive outlook, to focus on the long term, to think about the potential to lift billions out of poverty. But every now and then, I get dragged back into the negative. Yesterday was one of those days. I felt crushed.

And then, something amazing happened. Over the next several hours, tens, dozens, then hundreds of people responded. I sat reading the responses with tears in my eyes. An outpouring of positivity washed over me. People I have never met jumped to my defense, reminding me that they started their journey after watching my videos, or reading my books. Some people attacked the original criticism and its author (which I strongly discourage). But the vast majority focused on optimism.

Not only did people remind me of the importance of my work, they also encouraged each other to support me. In the last year, I have gradually received more and more of my income from Patreon. Patreon allows me to regain my financial security without switching my focus to commercial conferences, banking and investment events and chasing the next paycheck. Because of Patreon, I managed to stop selling and finally HODL. Because of Patreon I can dedicate my entire focus to the people who I have always felt like I am working for: the community of crypto-currency dreamers, visionaries and creators. I now finally get to work for you.

Yesterday, you fed my soul. You reminded me why it is so important to remain optimistic, focused and determined to overcome the cynicism. It's been a long and hard road. Sometimes I get lost. But, every time I do, you step up and help me find my way, find my focus again. You show me that I do not walk alone on this path. You are all there with me. I am part of a wonderful community and you have my back.

Today, I am even more focused on my goals: educate the next 10 million users. Train the next 10,000 developers. Do it all in every medium possible. Do it in more languages. Do it with more energy, with more passion. Do it with unrelenting optimism. In the end, my engine runs on hope, it runs on optimism. And today, it's turbocharged.

Thank you",1512601468

This semester I'm taking 3 classes. For the sake of anonymity I will just say they are STEM and specific to my major.

I'm not going to lie. I am so stressed out and crunched for time that I honestly feel like I'm starting to lose it. I commute an hour each way, work 8 hours a day (Mon - Fri), and have classes mornings and nights. I'm averaging about 5 hours of sleep a nigtht, but some nights I'm so stressed out that I can't fall asleep. 

I have very little time to study. If I learn something Monday and have a quiz on it Wednesday that gives me no time to study for it because when I'm not in class I'm at work. The only time I really have to study is on the weekends. I spend maybe 8 hrs a day during the weekends in the library, but even after that I still know I'm going to fail at least one of my classes, because I'm just not getting it. That specific class has SI and tutoring, but I can't go because my schedule doesn't allow it. I've just accepted that at this point either something finally clicks or just treat this as prescribed for the next semester when I retake it.

I would really like to talk to someone about certain thoughts I'm having, but I can't because all the available appointments to see a mental health counselor are during work hours. I don't really have the type of job where I can be flexible or regularly take time off. I know there is some type of group on campus for ""non-traditional"" students like myself but they are during working hours. I feel like every resource at this school is unavailable to me even if it's specifically targeted towards me. 

I don't have family to help me. To make a long story short, I'm was an orphan so I don't have any type of family that could help me out in anyway. I'm entirely on my own in life.

Maybe I'm just not smart enough to major in a STEM field. Maybe I am but I just don't have the time. I don't want to graduate in 10 years. I mean I suppose that might be the only way because with this type of work load I'm worried I'll do something crazy and kill myself from the stress.

Honestly if life is this hard what is the fucking point? If I have to be in this much pain to get a degree then how is it worth it?

I know I'm just complaining but life is so difficult I just don't even feel like it's worth it anymore. I'm tired of platitudes that do nothing to alleviate the suffering and hopelessness that I feel everyday. I don't know what to do. I don't expect anyone to have any advice for me, I just need to let it out or I feel like I'm going to snap.

I brought it up to my boss in a meeting and it was immediately forwarded onto our heads of IT. Once I created a ticket I was told that this was a known issue and was given a “solution.”

...Only problem is the solution that was pitched is literally impossible to implement company-wide and would effectively halt all of our company’s development efforts. I’ve now gathered a list of all vulnerable users and I’ve demonstrated how easy the attack is (takes less than 5 minutes and can be automated for many users), and showed that every single up line of mine, all the way to the CEO, is in the list.

I’m afraid they’re going to come back and say that all employees are considered part of their “trusted system” and therefore we don’t need to be concerned. But if that was a legitimate answer, then we wouldn’t have seen over 100m SSNs leaked from Equifax, so obviously not all companies are the greatest at hiring trustworthy people.

Any recommendations for making them understand the severity of this issue?

If not, can anyone recommend a good bash-based keylogger or something so I can really show these guys our system is broken?

I read your WSJ article today. I feel deceived by you.

You requested to speak with me, so I took time out of my day to do so. We talked for 20 minutes, during which time I conveyed to you my sentiments about the Bitcoin ecosystem and the matter of MtGox's collapse. My message was unambiguously a positive one. I didn't focus whatsoever on the personal funds I lost at Gox. Indeed, the impetus for your call was my heartfelt post on Reddit. 

Yet, you ignored everything I said. The only quote that you published from me in the Journal's cover story was """"That's gone now,"" said Mr. Veerhoos, who is based in Panama City, Panama. ""There's no chance of getting that back now."""" 

Is that really the takeaway you had from our call and from my letter? Is that your idea of journalism? Did I come across with the sentiment of a despairing investor whose confidence has been rattled? It seems you were happy to completely ignore my sentiments, preferring instead to cherry pick the one fact that is least important, in order to paint a narrative that Bitcoin's biggest problem is that it's not ""regulated.""  I didn't expect you to quote everything I said, but should you not have maintained at least a modicum of fidelity to my message?

I have dedicated my life to building and supporting the Bitcoin project. I don't give a damn about the money I lost at Gox. That's not important. What is important is that Bitcoin is resilient and enduring, and will continue to grow and change the world for the better. It is a story of human progress through technology. It is a story of the good seeping into the cracks of a corrupted financial system. It is a story of passionate people struggling against all odds to remedy the calamities brought down upon society from the most potently misguided people and institutions on Earth. 

Next time you spend your efforts casting a pall over this cause, please don't ask me to contribute mine. 

 -Erik Voorhees

PS - I will be posting this letter openly on Reddit. I will post your reply if you'd like. And if I do, I won't cherry pick the most misleading points of it, and I will spell your name correctly.

**CSUF Plan to Transition to Virtual Instruction**

Dear Titan Family:

As   referenced in the campus-wide communication from President Virjee   yesterday, the rapidly-changing information and guidance provided to us   by the CSU Chancellor’s Office along with local and state public health   officials require that we be equally dynamic in our efforts to prevent   the transmission of COVID-19 on our campus.

To be clear, **our campus remains safe**, and while we continue to **have zero presumptive or confirmed cases of COVID-19** on or related to our campus, we are bolstering our preventative and social distancing measures to include the following:

1. Effective   tomorrow, March 12, 2020, CSUF permits and strongly encourages all   faculty to commence the delivery of non-face-to-face teaching modalities   to the full extent that it is feasible and in service to course   requirements. All instructional spaces on campus have been equipped with   audiovisual tools to facilitate the delivery of remote teaching.   Faculty may choose to deliver the course content through synchronous   (real-time) or asynchronous (on-demand) modalities.
2. Effective   March 17 and March 18, virtual teaching will temporarily become   mandatory for the purpose of a two-day technology trial that will help   prepare the campus for full mandatory non-face-to-face delivery.
3. Effective   March 19 and March 20, the voluntary period in bullet one (1) above   will resume with faculty strongly encouraged to continue to teach   remotely and/or virtually.
4. Effective   Monday, March 23, and Tuesday, March 24 all face-to-face AND virtual   instruction will be suspended with the exception that normal   asynchronous online classes will continue as scheduled. The purpose for   these two non-instructional days is to allow faculty and staff to make   the final adjustments for alternative delivery teaching.
5. **Effective Wednesday, March 25, CSUF will suspend all in-person and on-campus convening of classes** **until April 26th, 2020**,   with that date being subject to reassessment based on circumstances as   they develop. During this time, faculty will teach all of their  classes  remotely through the use of the above-mentioned technology.

**To Summarize:**

* March 12 - voluntary but encouraged virtual instruction begins.
* March 17 and March 18 - virtual instruction mandatory for technical trial.
* March 19 and 20 - voluntary but encouraged virtual instruction resumes. 
* March 23 and March 24 – two non-instructional days to adjust and prepare.
* March 25 through April 26 - virtual instruction mandatory.

**The campus will remain open during every phase of these precautionary efforts,**   and students continue to be welcome to utilize all on-campus  amenities,  including housing, food services, the Health Center, the  library and  CAPS. Concerned students are free to limit their physical  engagement  with the campus, but offices and buildings will remain open  with  uninterrupted operations; staff will continue to work on site.

Certain   courses and activities, such as some performing arts and laboratory   research, will continue to meet face-to-face with approval from the   respective College’s dean. In these instances, social distancing   accommodations will be implemented. We will continue to work on possible   non-face-to-face modalities for these classes as well.

**Faculty**:   You will receive further instruction and support from Academic Affairs   and IT along with your deans and chairs. Further communications are   forthcoming.

**Students**:   Please check in with your professors and look for communications from   them for their plans in the courses you are enrolled in. If you have   questions, please contact your professor.

**Staff**: Further communications will be sent to you from HRDI. Contact your supervisor if you have any questions or concerns.

As   set forth in the communications to our community yesterday, CSUF will   continue to monitor any spread of COVID-19 and issue additional notices   as necessary. Information is available and will be regularly updated  on  the University’s website at [http://coronavirus.fullerton.edu/](https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoronavirus.fullerton.edu%2F&data=02%7C01%7C%7C38ee83fbc5424a5b24d708d7c5fe9c22%7C82c0b871335f4b5c9ed0a4a23565a79b%7C0%7C0%7C637195569631056407&sdata=uOh4D%2BcY7WIFhG8GbBVTBgMppbEQ0l%2FShruJlaufQ0w%3D&reserved=0).

Thank you for your continued cooperation, empathy, kindness, and support.

It uses embedding representation for each paper, so you can get recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations. Easy to run in Google Colab",computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/9g3g99/hey_rcomputerscience_i_made_a_research_paper/,"I made a research paper recommender for Machine Learning and Computer Science in general, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains 1,666,577 papers, mostly in the computer science field. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. 

https://i.imgur.com/B4qdoCC.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg


###Where is it?

Github

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/Research2VecPublicPlayGround.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0ggLs2r-5nWDWb-TNWqR2osaiXqNEsL

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

> ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough >enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

Here's a quick video demonstration:

https://youtu.be/tlutFm1meMs

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). If using the title to search, don't forget to use only lower case letters only. 

https://snag.gy/3yjx2o.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

Insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change this line 

`extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 + paper3 + paper4`

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 4 to get a TSNE map of the recomendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in May 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 20 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 1,666,577 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit (kinda like Facebook SentEval https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval ) that I can use to tune the hyperparameters. 

This feedback will also be helpful in my future plans, where I am planning on incorporating several other measures of similarity, and then use a attention mechanism to weight them for a final similarity. One method of content analysis I would really like to use is Contextual Salience https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08493. Another was something another Redditor just pointed out is cite2vec https://matthewberger.github.io/papers/cite2vec.pdf

Using a combo like this would help in one of the reoccurring hard search cases I encountered in R&D, which was trying to look up parameters of a particular method, when the method itself is not the focus of the paper. I was just actually encountering this issue when doing my project. I wanting to know more about what optimal hyperparameters others have found when working with embedding representations. This may not be the main topic of the paper, but it may have been described in the methods section of the paper. But this is hard to search for since paper searches mainly focus on the main subjects of the paper.

Of course, I would very much appreciate whatever feedback, questions, comments, thoughts you have on this project.

I've never really considered academia in CS and don't really know anything about the state of it, seeing as I'm not an actual CS student right now. So I'm trying to ask around to kind of gauge I guess what it's like, how easy it is to get into, how demanding it is, how fixated on paper publishing it is (physics certainly is) etc. I just always see CS students talk about getting jobs is all and never academia, but I'm unsure if that's because of money being a big motivator in why people go into CS in the first place (it's not too much of a concern for me) or because it's worth avoiding compared to private sector environments. 

I get it would help if I could be specific about \*what\* I'd want to research, but I'm still only in second year and more just thinking ahead right now, so I can't be too exact. Generally though, I know that security, anonymity and cryptography are big interests of mine. 

Any info would be appreciated, thanks. ",1552182871

I just started learning python last week. I started at code academy, just focusing on some of the basics and understanding the idea of fuctions, variables, rules of syntax, etc. It was fun and surprisingly easy to get into. After a while, I decided I wanted to really see what I could do to use some of this knowledge to my advantage. I stumbled onto this website https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ which had a nice little rundown on automating keyboard and mouse presses. 

I do a lot of repetitive data entry. The software we use at my job is bloated and clunky, so it is not the funnest to navigate. Throughout the years I've perfected manually entering all the information I need to, but it is really tedious and would take me about 5 minutes at top speed. 

This is where python comes in. I ended up, over the last week, working on the below code to automate entering data in 4 of the most common scenarios I come across day to day. I know it is a mess. There are a lot of redundant pauses and code that may not make sense. I'm still learning, but I am so happy that I finally got it all working how I envisioned. 

Making a GUI was harder than the mouse/kb automation. But it makes the data entry so much easier than having to manually edit values in the script and run them one by one. This way, everything pops up and I can just tab away to the fields I need to enter. 

All in all it took about 12 hours of work. But now it cuts those 5 minutes of boring data entry to 1 minute of not having to do anything (with plenty of room to work on bringing that down!) Unfortunately I can't show you the script in action for security reasons. If there is anything that you notice that could be improved, please let me know. The GUI is horrendous but functional in its current state.

I know this is not the most exciting or useful thing for anyone but me, but I was literally rushing with adrenaline when it was finally all working. 

[Here's what the GUI looks like:](https://i.imgur.com/Nm4qTIA.png) I was going for that early 2000's software crack vibe. Just missing the shitty midi music.

[And my desktop icon to run the script](https://i.imgur.com/2OZBHZ0.png) 

Anyway, not to ramble on. Just wanted to share a story as someone who went from absolutely no knowledge to actually producing something worthwhile in a short amount of time. Python rocks!

I have been slowly converting them to cash with random buyers etc....Besides the few charge-backs and scumbags it has gone over well....I now have enough money to live the rest of my life off of if I am careful.....Funny to think that in 2016 I was flat broke and had nothing to my name. I will be honest the long drawn out process of changing them into cash is tiring and I still have plenty left in my wallets.....I just wanted to ask if the community would be interested in a kind of scavenger hunt for a few wallets I have loaded with some BTC...Possibly jsut to bring people together and spread what is left to those who can no longer afford to get bitcoins or whatever....If you guys are interested, upvote or just let me know...I plan on making it fun...btw i went out yesterday and bought a few troy ounces of gold I was going to throw into the crates I plan on hiding these in.....I can only do U.S i cannot travel to europe.....


EDIT: Sweet....give me a few days to get stuff together. Ill do somthing online too for the international community...lets hope they keep going up and dont plummet like they did today.

EDIT2: I cannot say where in the U.S that would make it too easy lol. Also, too all you guys saying its fake....ok I love you all the same. I am just trying to give back. I choose this way because it is anonymous and no one will ever know who I am. I do not want attention on a personal level. I want people to come together towards a common goal. I love seeing people happy. I have seen anger and violence my whole life and I am tired of it. If this means someone can give their wife a new house, or their husband a new car or their kids a good education. I have accomplished my goal. I have one life to give and live, and my actions define who I am, not my wealth. In the end money is just numbers and means nothing when you die. If you want to participate....cool, if not....cool.

​

I'm going to be graduating this upcoming spring. I am applying for a program and if accepted I'd be teaching english in Japan anywhere between 1 - 5 years. The main reason I am doing this is because I'm just kind of burned out at this point in life and I would like to do something different before I settle down in a tech company. I also want to try and use this program as a foot in the door into working in the game industry in Japan. My concentration is in games so it'd be cool to get the chance to work at Nintendo, Sony, Square Enix, etc....

​

I'd like to know if anyone here was in a similar situation where maybe they didn't go into the tech industry right after college and if so how did you keep your skills fresh? One thing that comes to mind for my situation in particular is getting to know other CS majors participating in the program and possibly collaborating on projects. There are definitely other CS people I have met online who want to  participate in the program while they are young and have nothing tying them down.

Obviously nothing is set in stone and a lot of things are still in the air but it's just something that I've been thinking about lately and I'd appreciate other people's insight",1535102643

The exercises are targeted at beginners and so I think they should teach people the pythonic way of doing stuff. I'm no expert in Python at all but even I found so many things that are just not the way it should be done. I feel like they transferred the Java solutions to Python. To give you some examples what I mean:

 * worst thing first: They override the  str name space, by supplying str as an argument in functions or assigning some string to it.

 * Java wording: they constantly refer to lists as arrays

 * Non Pythonic solutions: when accessing the last element of a list they write array[len(o)-1], instead of array[-1]

We use the Reddit API (PRAW) to extract the most recent 100 comments from a user. We take those comments and extract sentences that aren't too long and aren't too short. Each sentence is then analyzed using the NLTK Sentiment Analyzer Vader Module and scored based on how positive, negative, and neutral it is. We then rank the analyzed users in order from most positive to least positive.

3514,DFA5ZS2TMIM9J5RY9RW6YN1QV,a_quick_glance,Tips for Freshman - from a CSUF grad. (These tips can also be useful for any student),csuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/csuf/comments/2edmmr/tips_for_freshman_from_a_csuf_grad_these_tips_can/,"I wanted to give you guys some tips because there were so many things that I wish I had known during my freshman year. I have been looking at posts on here lately, and I never knew that you can take the bus for free by using your titan card. That would have been so useful to know. Feel free to give your own tips down below. 

1) At CSUF, [only 17% of students graduate within four years and only 53% graduate within six years.](http://www.fullerton.edu/analyticalstudies/degrees_grad/graduation_FTF.html) The sad truth is that most students don't study as much as they need to because they don't know how to study or make that transition from studying 3 hours to 20 hours a week. Many people flunk out of college or drop out because they didn't do any research about careers and they have no idea what to major in. Your school will have free resources to help you get the grades and research careers. Your school will offer free tutoring, you can visit your professors during their office hours and ask them for advice about how to study or you can ask them specific questions if you are confused about what you are learning, your school will have a [Learning Center](http://www.fullerton.edu/ulc/) with free handouts and workshops that will give you tips on how to study, they will have a [Writing Center](http://english.fullerton.edu/writing_center/) where someone will go over your essays with you and give you tips on how to improve your papers. Your school will also have a [Career Center](https://www.facebook.com/CSUFcareer) where you can meet with Career Counselors, attend workshops, they will look over your resume and cover letters and give you tips, they will have career fairs, they will have local job and internship postings. You can ask Career Counselors any questions that you may have. See Career Counselors a few times a year. 

2) If you want to get a 3.5, then you probably have to plan on being in class for about 15 hours a week and studying around 20+ hours a week. That is only 35 hours a week and is less than a full time job. If you need to study more than 20 hours, then adjust your schedule if you happen to get too many B's after your first tests. Sure, some people only need to study 15 hours a week but most people need to study more than that. You also may want to watch study advice videos on Youtube. Look up: ""how to get straight A's"", ""how to study"", ""how to take notes in college"", ""how to get good grades in college"" etc. It would also be a good idea to read articles about how to do well in school. During my last two years of school, I almost always studied over 25 hours a week to get the grades I wanted. 

3) I once watched a Zach Braff movie that mentioned that your grades in college don't matter - that is not true. Your grades matter very much because you want grad school to be an option for you. You are young, and you are not sure what you want right now. Later on you may figure out you want a career that requires you to attend grad school. Many Postgraduate programs will want you to have a 3.5 or above. 

Here are some examples of the average GPA's that are accepted for a few Postgraduate education programs:

* [3.52](http://www.apta.org/ProspectiveStudents/Admissions/PTProcess/) is the average accepted GPA for Physical Therapy programs 
* [3.8](http://slhs.sdsu.edu/programs/ma/admission-requirements/) is the average accepted GPA for SDSU's Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences MA program
* [3.3](http://publichealth.sdsu.edu/programs/graduate/mph/environmental-health/admissions/) is the average accepted GPA for SDSU's Public Health program
 
4) See your professors during their office hours. I was very lucky to receive this advice from one of my professors on my very first day of college. He told us that your professors like when students come in to ask questions, that you should always make sure your professors know your name, and you should make sure to stop by and see all of your professors during their office hours even if it is just to introduce yourself and say ""hello."" I saw over 80% of my teachers during their office hours. It paid off tremendously. I got some great help and advice from them over the years, I sort of became friends with a couple of them, and I also received really great recommendation letters from them in case I decide to pursue grad school. 

5) Read the news. The news will discuss what careers will be in demand in the future. You can pick majors, join clubs, and get internships based on careers that will actually be in demand. 

6) Make sure to thoroughly research majors and careers before your sophomore year even starts. I'd say spend at least 30-40 hours researching careers before your sophomore year starts. 

7) Join clubs. I wanted to learn about social media, so I joined the [PRSSA](https://www.facebook.com/csufprssa). I was not a PR or Communications major. You can join any student organization you want, it doesn't matter what your major is. Joining the club was invaluable to me and it was the best decision I probably made while I was in college. 

* They have speakers that come in, who work in that particular field, and talk about their current job and past jobs, they give advice to students about how to prepare for life after graduation, they sometimes offer internships to the students in the clubs, they let you ask questions about their field. Hearing different people speak about different jobs and companies in the field that you want to work in helps you narrow down exactly what you want to do and what companies you want to work for. You are more prepared to go off on your own and understand the real world. 
* Clubs offer a lot of networking opportunities. My association hosted larger networking opportunities as well as some smaller networking opportunities as well. My favorite thing I did was go on a company tour to a tech company in Irvine and I got to ask the Social Media Director a ton of questions and I really picked her brain and I added her on LinkedIn. 

* My club actually had a member who went searching for internship postings for us, which was great because applying to internships isn't as stressful when everything is organized for you. 

* You get to chat with people who are interested in the same things you are and you can make friends.

8) Get internships. I think the only reason I have a job right now is because I had three internships while I was in college. 

9) Be nice, friendly, and charming. I have had my grades pushed up because I often participated in class and my professors liked me. 

10) Don't be afraid to go to community college. CSUF is so expensive. It's pretty stupid to go there if you don't receive any grants or scholarships. Spend you first two years, or three, at a community college. You will pay about $2,500 for parking passes because most people graduate after five years. I think parking passes are about $50-$100 a year at community colleges. Ugh, everything is so much cheaper at a CCC. 

**Extra Tips:**

1)There is a computer lab in the basement of McCarthy Hall that many students seem to not know about

2)There is a Trader Joe's off Imperial Hwy. You can get really tasty and cheap salads and sandwiches there. I also like their snack selection and I think their sushi is really good too. 

3) Like [CSUF on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CSUFofficial) to learn about helpful and free workshops, free food, interesting opportunities etc. 

4) Don't be afraid to hang out with new people and try new things. Say ""yes"" to almost everything. 

5) Be nice. Offer to let people copy your notes. Buy an extra scantron in case someone forgets theirs. 

6) Use Google Drive to take notes and write papers. That way, you don't ever have to use flash drives. I have never owned a flash drive. Google Docs is just so convenient. 


Sorry for my grammar mistakes. I wrote this pretty quickly. Feel free to ask any questions or let me know if you want me to elaborate on anything. 

Here is a [Guide for Freshman](http://www.oswego.edu/academics/opportunities/honors/program/dowell.html) from SUNY Oswego. I think it is a very accurate and helpful guide.  

Edit: Spelling and general editing. Again, I apologize for any grammatical errors that I have made.

7 years ago, I was a college student. My college doesn't teach me advance programming, but only basic of all programming language ( I learn from QBASIC, Visual Basic, Java, Cobol, C, C++, and more).

I love C/C++ back then, but I found some barrier while learning it. The barrier is: Different compiler and preprocessor while using different OS.

So I decided to learn one language that running in all platform. The first choice is Perl. I love because I can simplify and ""code golfing"" while code. But Perl is not my answer, because after 1 week writing the code, I forgot why I wrote in that way. I create many vapor code using Perl.

So, I need other solution for it. And my choice is Python.

&#x200B;

My college doesn't teach me Python, so I decided to **pirate** [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-5th-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730). For 1 month and 2 weeks, I learn that e-book.

I also create some script for my private hobby (scrapping from online manga, automation file clean up), and much more.  
After about 6 month practice with Python, I try to apply programming job using the knowledge I know.

For about 2 years works after that, I finish my college also pay all my college debt (with salary about $150 per month). 1 year after that, I own my first laptop (Yes, while I am on college, I don't have either PC or Laptop for learning, I either go to rent or my friend).

&#x200B;

Fast forward to present time ... My life is better, much better salary than before, and no debt. I also compensate for pirating the book by [buying that](https://imgur.com/a/2ud20FQ).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR;

\- Python change my life from college student with full of debts into full time programmer

\- Its all about your will to learn, even without facility, you should find your way

\- Atone your sin",1549905501

You know, as a currency?

Look, I get it, when you buy in at 10 grand you don’t want to buy a hotdog with bitcoin at 4 grand, everybody’s afraid of becoming the next million dollar pizza. But putting the coin in a wallet and doing nothing accomplishes nothing (except for added anxiety)

Often times, for each of these individual topics, there is no concrete overview of all the sub-topics involved. This makes fully understanding the topic and the overall field harder. 
To me, when learning a new topic, it is a good idea to first have an pictorial overview of it, and then in the process of understanding the detail, keep referring back to the picture. At the end of the learning process, zoom out, and link all the related parts together.
(Like solving photo puzzles, we assemble all the parts into the frame at the end.)

An example of such picture will be similar to the following (inside the linux kernel): 
http://turnoff.us/geek/inside-the-linux-kernel/
This picture is not the best to express what I mean, but it has the general idea there. 
Think of each object as a node (or topic/subtopics), and there are lines connecting the nodes. (The lines denote relationships between nodes.)
Another example would be something similar to those ""Javascript in one picture"" kind of pictures.
Since I have yet seen any pictures that I look for, I do not know how to concretely express it.. (maybe I can do better after a good night a sleep).

In any case, if any of you know of any similar pictures, please let me know. Or if there's no such picture exist, I would like people who is knowledgeable enough in the field to make such pictures. It will surely help not just the newcomers but also some of those who are already familiar with the general topology of the field.
I would like to use these kind of pictures to help others in their learning.

Assume its sorted in ascending order. So some examples would be 
if the given array is 
1,1,4,5 and the sum is 9, it returns true
also if it is 1,1,2,3,5,11 and the sum is 10 it still returns true (problem originally asked only for a pair of integers)
assume no negative numbers, the sum could be in the array in that case just return true. So I write a piece of code about this and seems to work (let me know if it doesn't I'm not totally sure) but I couldn't figure out it's time complexity, since it the number of iteration kind of affects the number of recursive steps, so anyway here is to code

EDIT: good and helpful people found errors/bugs in my code so I corrected them as best as I can but I'm still sure there are some, the question is though, still, what is the time complexity of this. Also, what do you think the worst case scenario for this algorithm

    bool isThereSum(int* arr,int size, int sum){
        static bool check = false;
        if(check)
            return false;
        for(int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            if(arr[i] == sum)
                return true;
            else if(arr[i] < sum){
                sum = sum - arr[i];
                size--;
                if(isThereSum(arr,size, sum));
                    return true;
                else
                    sum = sum + arr[i];
            }
            if(size <= 0)
                check = true;
        }
        return false;
    }
it works by crossing the largest number in the array smaller than the index, then looks for other number that can make it equal to sum, so if the array was 1,2,3,7,8,11 and the sum was 17, the sum would be 6, it would ignore 8 and 7, then the sum would be 3, then 1,then 0 and that would return true.

So starting today, you can get **Python 201: Intermediate Python** free through [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/py201#) or [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com/python201/c/201free). 

If you go with Gumroad, then you will need to use the following offer code: **201free**. Note that if you want to receive updates to the book, you will want to create an account and add the book to your library. 

I currently support the following digital formats: **PDF**, **epub** and **mobi** 

You might also want to check out my blog which has lots of fun Python tutorials and links to my other books: http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/

**Update 2016-10-17**: For those of you who like numbers, I thought I'd share a bit of statistics with you. The number of people who used the Leanpub link to download the book hit **18,037** while approx. **6670** people used the Gumroad coupon. I don't have a simple way of checking who used both sites, so assuming that no one did, the total number of new readers is **24,707**!

That's so awesome! Thanks so much for your interest. I hope you all enjoy the book!",1476739595

I thought I would buy and sell some, and try to spend on real world things, etc.  I've been watching bitcoin for a long time, of course, and I thought it past due to test it as a consumer - how hard is it, how confusing is it, etc.

Anyway, I mentioned this on twitter and a guy asked for my BTC address (which is: 1McNsCTN26zkBSHs9fsgUHHy8u5S1PY5q3 ) and last night a bunch of people got all excited and sent me BTC.  Obviously I'm going to cash all that out in a few days and send it onward to the Wikimedia Foundation so if you want to keep doing that, I'm ok with it.

In the meantime, I am still learning and I've seen some chatter about me moving the BTC from that address.  I think people are referring to this: https://blockchain.info/tx/29f8972043a293ad2168b62a85e8c9576d8ce6a02d624b9728e33143cae44d64

I didn't do that.  When I first saw it (I'm a newbie, remember!) I was slightly alarmed.  But someone else said that maybe it is coinbase moving it into cold storage.  And when I log into my coinbase account, I don't see anything missing, i.e. I see incoming transactions but no outgoing ones.

How can I best confirm?

I'm planning to re-open the conversation with the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Directors at our next meeting (and before, by email) about whether Wikimedia should accept bitcoin.  One reason (not the only reason) that we haven't is that setting it up as an option during the fundraiser has a lot of implications (we know, for example, and you will likely find this counterintuitive, that the more payment options we give people, the less they donate).  But it occurs to me that they could just set up an account on coinbase and announce it via social media, and not bother with integrating it into donation screens and all that.  The BTC community is pretty close-knit and generous, so that'd probably work pretty well.

tl;dr - I'm playing with bitcoin, thinking about it, and have some questions about how to look at blockchain.info.

You can confirm the address above by looking at my twitter: https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/441634501265862657

And this reddit account is known to be associated with me, I think I confirmed it by posting on my wikipedia user page or something like that.",1394478490

&#x200B;

I wanted to share some thoughts I had about my experience during my first semester as an MBA student - some things I liked and some things I didn't like. If this impacts at least one person I'll be satisfied.

&#x200B;

I've been out of school for a few years. I went back mostly because I hate my job, and I needed something to distract me from my pain. 

&#x200B;

The two classes I took (not going to mention, don't ask) presented a fairly steep learning curve - as a Statistics undergrad with no business class experience, I have no knowledge of accounting principles or business jargon. Nearly every assignment is filled with acronyms and financial statements that I had to look up the meaning of online, and nearly continuously referring to them.

&#x200B;

During case report discussions, I came to realize that the optimal way of presenting information is similar to a TED talk - be engaging, have simple speech, and be extremely comfortable speaking confidently to a large group. Substance matters after these.

&#x200B;

There's a really wide variance in how difficult the classes can be - some classes you are yawning and wondering if this was worth your money, the next has you scraping the bucket for every last second to spend on an assignment that ""has no right answer"". The last few weeks of this semester I took vacation days from work to spend extra time doing homework. Granted, I am extremely thorough and put a lot of time into my assignments, but I want to get the most bang for my buck here - I don't want to leave any effort on the table.

&#x200B;

Working full time and taking classes will cause you to seriously evaluate how you spend your time. I generally go to the gym three times per week, but during this semester at most I could go once per week and sometimes there were multiple weeks where I could not go at all. I made up for this lack of time by going onto the ketogenic diet and walking more at work. I also had to shelve all the books I was reading/listening to through audible so I could focus on reading the course materials. 

&#x200B;

I found that I was leading two lives - me at work and me at school. 

&#x200B;

Me at work is a nobody - a low level analyst for a team that does unimportant work for a company that doesn't need us. I've been here for almost three years and have come to understand how little I matter on a macro or micro level. All of the things I tried to break out of that mold - failure. I'm not saying I wasn't deserving of failure, but trying to increase engagement and reduce turnover in a place where that isn't encouraged should at least be recognized as important work. I will always remember the organizational inflexibility, highly structured hierarchy, lack of care for employees, lack of idea implementation, and lack of vision for the future, and for that I am grateful. These memories will never leave me.

&#x200B;

Me at school is an impactful person. I had an idea that went to the top of the college and was implemented nearly immediately. I was suggested to be the initial speaker for a group of clients due to the energy and storytelling ability I bring to the podium. I hold this as a great accomplishment because when I first started I could not clearly articulate one sentence. I have been able to do so due to the effort and care of my classmates, professor, and school culture. Without that environment I would not succeed, and for that I am grateful.

&#x200B;

My classmates ran the spectrum from disappointing to enthralling. Some people had finished their undergraduate degree and jumped straight into the MBA program without work experience, and it showed. Some people were business owners and using this experience to level up and recruit for their business at the same time. Still others were in the corporate world and looking to move up amid juggling family and work obligations. I've learned something from each of these people, and for that opportunity I am grateful.

&#x200B;

In another way, my classmates were supremely disappointing. There tends to be a mixture of tenure within the classes, and inside one group there were people who were just about to graduate. It soon became clear to me that their interest level in the class dropped early and dropped hard, and it was all they could muster to meet the lower requirements. I recall repeatedly venting my frustrations to my wife - 'If you've been here for two years, why wouldn't you take care of and help out the newer people?! Why wouldn't you mentor them in the same that you wish your company mentored you?!? Why wouldn't you finish as strongly as possible, as opposed to weakly walking across the finish line?!?"" Should I continue with the program, I will fix this. I'm extremely grateful for being in a situation that gave me this idea. I will work very hard to make it successful, should I continue with the program. 

&#x200B;

I learned that an MBA program probably isn't worth it. Sure you're learning things, but I was learning well on my own before I started going back to school. Arguably, I could get a part time job for one day a week in sales and end up with more money and a more applicable education after one year. I still may actually pursue this route - I'm going to attend for one more semester and see how I feel at the end of it. Thinking that I will have to keep going for another 2 years is disheartening, and paying $30K for the privilege of losing nearly all my free time is even more so.

&#x200B;

This is already way longer than I meant it to be, but it's a good start I think. Thanks for sticking with me.",1557888783

I was full of enthusiasm which helped me through a difficult term. For the most part, I did well but there were times I hit brick walls that wouldn’t budge for weeks.

I started my 2nd term studying C++ the beginning of January and felt like I was having my ass handed to me everyday. I honestly didn’t know if I’d be able to do what was being asked of me.

Then things clicked. Not by magic but with lots of trial and error, coding in my free time, and really diving into the material. Now I might run into a small problem that makes makes me scratch my head but I generally know how to approach things. And I’m writing programs faster than I could ever imagine which is nice for my sanity.

So I just wanted to share this update because a. I posted a whiny vent session in January and b. to encourage anyone struggling with a language.

Advice: 
Coding is like math where you get better by doing it. Do your assignments and if there’s time, work on small projects of your own. I use my own assignments (after turning it in of course) to play with and personalize.

I started writing tutorials which forces me to revisit material from the beginning. Find a free app and work through the problems even if it feels silly studying what you already know. I find myself not having to look up every little thing because I’m always refreshing my memory (no pun intended).

The thing that helps me most is talking through my problems. Get a rubber duck if you need to, pretend you’re teaching a class - verbalizing what’s going on and what you’re trying to achieve works wonders! And take a nap. Sometimes the best thing you can do is see a problem with fresh eyes.

With that being said, I still value my education enough to learn the content, and I don't intend on taking the class over again. So what are some of the best, concise resources on the internet I can use to study algorithms? I plan on doing this over the break which is about a month-long period. Thanks in advance!",1575642610

I've been wanting to learn python for a long time because I've been making computer graphics with blender 3D for over 10 years. 


So a little over a year ago I decided to start teaching myself. I started with codeacadamy's python course and then worked on several small personal projects. Such as automating some stuff at work. I then did [Udacitys Intro To Programming Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000) I overall feel pretty confident with python now, but it's hard to gauge how good you are at something if you don't reference it with other people. So here I am to share!



So I currently work as what is probably best described as a ""security guard supervisor"" all though it is a lot more than that. I work at a charity with a low income housing complex in which all guests or staff are required to sign in and out of the building. This is necessary because of certain laws requiring it with charities(it's complicated).  And also so roll calls can be done with the staff if there is a fire alarm.


Before they simply had a binder with a pen and paper to sign in and out. I asked around and found out that we could print barcodes easily on to our ID cards. So I figured the entire process is pretty low hanging fruit for automation. So I presented my idea to my manager and then later some directors and they approved, since it was practically a free solution, aside from my time on the clock. 


I did a back of the envelope calculation and determined this program would save about 400+ man hours a year. 


**TL;DR:** So long story short even though I'm a technically a security guard they let me write python and implement this new system. Which I've had a bunch of staff thank me for because the old way was a a lot more of a pain in the ass.

I'm working on a console app to spit out DND NPCs using complex nested json. Headache. Keep getting caught with key errors etc. I've been meaning to try the debugger for a while. So I fine a quick tutorial and its sooo easy I'm a fool for wasting time with print.. Gah!!

For those who have been avoiding it for whatever reason here is a really quick primer:

= If you're running 3.7+ (I think) just wack in a breakpoint() close to your problem area

= Run the programme. You'll be dropped into the debugger at that point.

= Commands I've used:   

list - gives you a couple of lines above and below the current line

pp <something> - prints out that something, this really helps with those awkward data bugs

next - goes to the next line

skip - skips going to the function call, but still runs the function

That's all I've been using so far. Anybody go some useful commands post away.",1570588667

But yesterday, after three years of panics, major changes, and many nights of feeling hopeless. I finally graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in Communications. Why did I bother sharing this on here? Well, I wanted to be a source of inspiration.  Two years ago, after too many bad decisions, I ended up getting academically disqualified, it was quite possibly the most difficult thing I have ever been through, telling people was difficult, it was essentially like getting being kicked out and it happened at the same time as I was dealing with other personal issues. But I still kept with it, I worked my way slowly back into the system, took a whole year, but I did it, changed my major in the process and I finally felt confident in what I was majoring in. I kept working hard, continued to be involved with my favorite club on campus, Adventure club, received counseling for depression and anxiety issue, and with help from financial aid, I achieved my degree. As I was walking through my commencement ceremony, I couldn't believe it, this is actually happening, I made such an improvement.

So now that I shared this all with you, I wanted to say to current students who might be in a similar situation that I am or may be doubting yourself and even thinking why are you still even in college, and I know this advice will be cliched, but what you are going through is normal, you are not week, you are not useless, you are still getting through it, and even if it's taking longer than four years, that's okay. It took me longer than four years as well.

To my fellow graduates, Congratulations on all of your accomplishments, and to the current students, keep at it and don't give up, in the end, it will all pay off and your family and friends will be so proud.

And thank you to CSUF for the memories, even if we didn't agree on everything.

This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I’m have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here’s a video I made covering these topics:

YouTube channel: Matt Upham

Video: How to get a software engineering internship in 2019

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - “friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an  \[type of engineer\]  in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey.",1553231328

If you are unaware of whats happening, here is a link to my original post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/csuf/comments/e6dec7/csuf\_computer\_science\_department\_is\_a\_joke\_and\_so/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csuf/comments/e6dec7/csuf_computer_science_department_is_a_joke_and_so/)

First and foremost, I would like to thank all of you who have been very supportive of the situation and have told me their perspective of the situation. I will be primarily editing my original post so make sure to follow along. This post was mainly to just bring upon attention upon a petition that I have created to further bring attention to our situation as students.

[http://chng.it/KkxZVK7jfv](http://chng.it/KkxZVK7jfv)

As students, I believe we all deserve the fair treatment of paying for a service, like education and receiving a product that is worth our money. Why is it okay for us to pay for a service and receive anything less than a good product? At the end of the day, WE, the students are paying for our professor's salary through part of our tuition fees. We shouldn't be fearful of our situation, having to gamble on getting a proper professor that is capable of teaching. We should be the ones taking charge if we are unsatisfied with our situation. I had received information that once again, said professor, is teaching next semester, which is unacceptable given the details from the main post. 

I highly recommend you sharing these posts and the petition in order to bring awareness about our situation. With the amount of talk these posts have been receiving throughout campus, it is evident that the Department and professors are aware of their situation and are simply choosing to ignore it instead of resolving the situation.

Again, I thank you all for understanding our situation and I hope for the Department to truly take action for the better.",1576077361

I’m currently working toward my B.A. in Computer Science. I love it, but it’s *such* a broad field, and I’m not even sure where to begin, career-wise. 

I already know that I much prefer working with software over hardware, and I have some experience as a programmer (Python and Java). I also love working with computer graphics and design. Movie CGI also seems interesting! Let’s just say that I love combining technology and creativity. :0

What do people usually get as entry-level jobs? What kind of internship should I get? And does anyone have any career suggestions based on my interests?

I’d also like to hear about *your* career, even if it doesn’t have to do with my interests. I’m always looking for new fields to explore within Computer Science!

**EDIT 1: With the expansion of the website to other universities, I've decided to change the URL of the website to** [**gradetier.com**](http://gradetier.com)**. Sorry for any confusion.** 

With FullertonGrades, you can see grade distribution information for over 8,000 classes, including which instructor taught which course. All undergraduate departments and courses from the Fall and Spring semesters of 2018-2019 should be included.

There are no paywalls, just a simple design: choose a department (and optionally a course number), and click on the desired course.

There were quite a few challenges in making this website, from getting the data from CSU Fullerton to dealing with the sheer amount of data, but all in all I think it could serve as a very useful resource in determining which classes to enroll in and with what instructor, especially for those weed-out classes and for pre-med folks.

I spend a lot of my time debating over in the other subreddit with BCH supporters because I believe BCH is a poor idea that is eventually going to lead to centralization, which Bitcoin can never succumb to. 

Over the past year, as bitcoin has become mainstream, we have all witnessed the price skyrocket and have all, in my opinion, become blinded by it. Bitcoin's has a MAJOR issue right now. Simply, day by day, wallets that have less than the minimum amount of satoshi/byte fee that will get a confirm in them are essentially useless/worthless. Also, any form of commerce for bitcoin is essentially impractical now. I was absolutely alarmed when in an interview, Jimmy Song was forced to answer what he would use as ""currency"" if he had to use it for an online transaction, and he said ""Visa"". I immediately realized just how absurd and hard headed the bitcoin community has become in this blocksize debate. People would rather push others wanting to purchase things online with Visa than to improve bitcoin immediately. My main issue with the current state of affairs in bitcoin is that we have lots of people offering us promises, but no immediately solutions. LN has been talked about for years now. So, what are we supposed to do... sit around and HOPE LN is immediately adopted when it comes out and everyone starts using it for low/no fees? I think.... no I KNOW one day it will be adopted, basically making all other cryptos obsolete. However, how far off is this? 1, 2, 3, 4 years? Nobody knows. But in the immediate/short future, what is the bitcoin community supposed to do? Sit around and pretend that $10 fees to make a simple transaction are OK? What happens if other cryptos decide to fill in that vacuum while we sat around waiting for LN, which by the way is not guaranteed to fix this fee issue. Even with LN, most smart people agree that at some point Bitcoin HAS to increase the blocksize. On LN, you still have to be opening/closing channels, plus people are always going to want to use the main blockchain to do transactions for maximum security. 

I think it's time the community backs a blocksize increase. We KNOW it has to happen at some point, so why not now? Bitcoin is in a very desperate place. Don't be fooled by this massive price spike. We have to make some serious decisions about what we are gonna do now to fix this. Sit around and wait for LN, or do the inevitable now, and increase the blocksize to 2mb. I'm officially putting my vote in for an immediate blocksize increase to 2mb.

And up to date structures, I was fine. Maybe since my DS course was in Java and my Prof was more concerned about GUI aspect of the program over the actual DS. However, after transferring to uni from my community college. I've been face first on a lot of my coding assignment. Takes me forever to knock out the code out and I would get low grades. Top it off, this is my third time taking systems programming. My first semester, I just gave up in that course. The second semester I buckled down and still failed due to the exams being 100% code based pen and paper exams. In my mathematics courses, I've done well, actually pursuing my minor in mathematics. So how do I get over this death by code? I can talk about the problem. Figure it how to do it( in theory), but when it comes to coding. I become a zen master...my mind goes blank.

Things I've tried. 
Bought intro/ crash course style books. Complete most of them. 
Would try r/ dailyprogramming exercises and cry myself into a ball. 

Last bit. I'm too far to turn back. I'm 3 core classes away from completing my major requirements. One of which is systems and the other I'm taking right now. All I would need are electives and programming languages. Since my concentration is in data science, all my electives will be what I need to gain my concentration. So I only need 7 more classes assuming I pass everything this semester. 

Any ideas? I will check this after my classes today around 1500 us mountain time. Thanks.

I was hoping some of the grad students could guide me toward a reading list of research papers in various ideas. I want to get an idea of the different areas of research in computer science, and eventually do a research at my university in that area.

**Some examples to get started:**

2. https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/topic.html#Anonymous\_20communication

Most of the replies as can be expected involved making tasks at work easier etc, which don't really apply to someone like me who doesn't have an office job or anything similar.

So, what are some cool uses for python for maybe younger people or just people without office jobs in general? It would be fun to find a project to work on or something that I can use python for in my daily life but as far as I'm aware i can't really think of anything that I need automated.

As a beginner, where should I begin with?",computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/bnnecs/i_am_confused_as_a_beginner_where_should_i_begin/,"So, for my background knowledge - I recently graduated my high school. I learned C++ language in my junior and senior year. I guess, I can say that I learned basics of the language, eg. about OOP concepts, functions, Classes, Inheritance, Arrays, Queues, Stacks, implementation of all three using linked lists (where I'm still fuzzy), File handling (in text and binary files and their I/O functions). 
I also put my hands on Java language in my sophomore year and learned easy-peasy concepts (which includes functions, classes and arrays only). We used the BlueJ platform to code in schools. I still feel like I learned no heavy or important stuff in that language. 
I'm not very keen in coding and computer science, in general. That comes from the fact that I always scored fair or low marks in my tests and felt like an idiot infront of bright kids. And I never did a project or built a software in my course (it was there but no one really cared for your real efforts). 
But sometimes, I find myself getting excited to do a problem or think about a logic for a piece of code. From my high school experience, programming was both a good and bad experience. It was good because I developed methodical nature, procedural way of solving and diffused thinking. It was bad because I had to memorize a few code pieces for implementation of same kind of programs, low confidence due to constant failure in coming up with new or better logics and my poor/slow typing skills (I am really ashamed of this in particular). 
Now, I want to expand and solidify my old concepts in Java and learn another language Python. I tried to look on EdX for a course, but there are so many for beginners. So I am confused about how and where to begin with. 
Can anyone please tell me more about this? I will also appreciate any other advices or criticisms. 
Thanks a lot for reading this far :)",1557684072

I am a junior in CS, I'm looking to learn web development on the side so I have some practical coding experience.  I've been wanting to do this for a long time but there always seems to be too many resources to choose from and I just end up doing nothing because its too overwhelming.  I recently came across a deal on Udemy.com for C++ and Unreal 4, which lead me to see some courses listed as ""The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp"", or something similar.  I was about to purchase one because it was only $15, but I figured that might be stupid given that there is a ton of free resources on the internet.  I figure its time I pick one site and stick to it so that I can finally learn this.  These are the ones I'm looking at:

* [Udemy Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/#curriculum)
* [Udemy Web Developer Course w/ Projects](https://www.udemy.com/web-developer-course/)
* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
* [University of Reddit](http://www.ureddit.com/)

Can anyone speak to their experiences with these? Is there one that stands out?  Should I just buy the Udemy course?  Any other suggestions are welcome too.  Thank you!

I do my best to produce tutorials for beginner-intermediate programmers, mainly by making sure nothing is left to abstraction and hand waving. 

The most recent series is an in-depth machine learning course, aimed at breaking down the complex ML concepts that are typically just ""done for you"" in a hand-wavy fashion with packages and modules. 

The machine learning series is aimed at just about anyone with a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn. If you're confused about something we're doing, I can either help, or point you towards a tutorial that I've done already (I have about 1,000) to help.

The main structure for the course is to:

* Do a quick overview of the theory of each machine learning algorithm we cover.
* Show an application of that algorithm using a module, like scikit-learn, along with some real world data.
* Break down the algorithm and re-write it ourselves, **without machine learning modules**, in Python.

We're not rewriting the algorithms with the intention that we're going to actually produce something superior than what's available, but rather to learn more about how the algorithms actually work, so that we understand them better. I also see a lot of people are very keen to learn about deep-learning, but the learning curve to get to that point is quite challenging, since quite a bit of deep learning requires you to have a wholistic understanding of how things are actually working, and not just a high-level understanding of how to use a module. Hopefully this can help. 

At least for me personally, I have learned a lot by breaking the algorithms down, so I thought I would share that in my tutorials.

All tutorials are posted on **[PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)** as well as **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)**, so you can follow along in video, text, or both forms, and the content is all free. 

We've done linear regression and K Nearest Neighbors so far, and have quite a long way to go still. We are going to be diving into the Support Vector Machine next, then clustering, neural networks and deep learning. Once we've made our way to deep learning, we're going to be working with TensorFlow.

If all that sounds interesting to you, come hang out and learn with us! 

I tend to release a couple videos a week. If you have suggestions/requests, feel free to share. 

Follow along with the text/video tutorials: on **[PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)** or **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)** ",1463092102

I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.

Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:

(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and

(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.""


Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order **who might have a constitutional presence in the United States**, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, **there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.**""  ... aka, they can take all your stuff without due process instantly if you have ""constitutional rights"" in the US (wow).


The rabbit hole is deep people.  This is almost as bad as the patriot act... a national emergency LOL what a joke.  **I pray that non of you donated to Snowden using Coinbase or any other bitcoin platform that keeps your identity on file**

4036,DCB58I5WFX8OUFP9EZJMOA74N,[deleted],I am looking for an introductory book on Computer Architecture,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/dx7zig/i_am_looking_for_an_introductory_book_on_computer/,"Hello, like the title says I want an introductory book on Computer Architecture. I already have Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach but that seems very high level. I was originally going to buy Hennessy and Patterson's Computer Organization and Design but some reviews are scaring me off from that. I am looking at Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi, but I am worried that it focuses too much on embedded systems. I want something more general and Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi's reviews sometimes make it seem like it covers Computer Architecture in the general sense.

So here's the criteria that I want:
1. The book should assume little knowledge of Computer Architecture
2. I learn best when I experiment so being a little interactive would be a plus
3. I want it to touch on some higher level topics like pipelining, branch predictions, machine code, cache, and possibly multicore processors

Thank you so much and I welcome any suggestions, or people who used Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi, does this book cover most of what I want?",1573945654

I just learned (after 7 years of experience of coding in Python) that `x or y` returns `x` if `x` is a true statement, or to `y` if `x` is a false statement. A statement is true when it makes an `if` statement succeed.

The most interesting `example` of this is that `None or value` evaluates to `value`. This will really help me to avoid these kind of statements: `self.attrib = value if value is not None else other_value`

I thought this would be nice to share.

He looked like in his older 60s'. At first, I thought he was a student that went there, but he mentioned being homeless during our conversation, which made more sense since he had a bunch of stuff with him such as parasail umbrella, containers, etc. I was asking him some personal questions regarding his past life and how did he ended up living on the streets. Long story short, he was electrician technician for a large aviation company back then until it was outsourced somewhere else. The guy was no idiot. He was a well spoken gentleman that knew what he was doing. He told me he prefer using the computer on universities compare to public library because of wide availability of computer and usage. (Also he said it gets him out of trouble lol) he said he's trying to get his master communication degree from I assuming a trade school. I was just curious if I should make a gofundmepage for this guy. I don't know the actual protocols but if i happen to see him again on campus during the weekends , should I ask him for permission or just take his photo conspicuously and just post his situation up without his permission. If I had too judge for myself, he doesn't seem like to have a free handout. He didnt ask for money or nothing. But if given the opportunity he told me he hopes to work as electrician consultant because of his age. (too tired for manual labor) overall I just believe this guy deserve a 2nd shot living his rest of his life in sheltered place rather than roaming on the streets with his bike. ",1517205845

Python is a very popular language.

It’s also one of the languages that I recommend for beginners to start with.

*But how do you go about learning this language?*

The best way to learn Python is to understand the big picture of all what you need to learn **before** you dive in and start learning.

In this article, I divide the *path of learning Python* into **6 levels.**

Each level covers a subset of the language that you need to master before you move on to the next one.

My focus on this article is for you to be a competent well-rounded  programmer so you can easily get a job at any tech company that you  choose.

But don’t worry, you don’t need to go all the way to level 6 in order to get your first job 📷

Wanted to leave a couple thoughts here. for whatever it's worth.  
I am graduating from CSUF at the tender age of 45; I decided to return to school more than twenty years after I graduated high school.  I did it for myself and my career, and I did it for my kids, two of whom are now college students.  It's taken me over 5 years to get my bachelor's while working full time, the last 4 years of which have me commuting to a job 2 hours away.  I don't say any of this for recognition or kudos.  I say this to you, presumably younger people, to offer this free advice, for what it's worth: Stay.  Finish.  Do not give up.  If you leave, you're not going back.  When pressure is high, and your classes are difficult, and you're not sure if you can do it?  You can.  You can do it.  
One other piece of advice, and again, I say this to people I imagine are probably half my age: Don't take any shit from anybody.  I can't tell you how many articles I have read in the last five years running down ""millennials"" as soft, spoiled, lazy or entitled.  That is bull shit.  Recognize that criticism for what it is.  The talk of an older generation desperately afraid of young people.  Bunch of old farts who started their adult lives banging on about sticking it to the man, but ended up tanking the job and housing market.  Ignore them.  
I have been continually amazed by my classmates' work ethic and commitment to excellence.  I have spent the last five years in classrooms with young people, and I see a generation that works hard, and will now have to support these ingrates in their old age.  
Anyways, sorry so long.  Good luck to all and kick ass, Titans.

It has always been my dream since I could remember and I love the subject very much.

When it comes to the theory of computer science I can quickly grasp it and understand it sometimes. 

However when it comes to the practical side of computer science such as coding and programming, I always seem to fail . 

How do I learn to be successful in both fields to be an adequate student?

For you computer science students that have been in the same position or can understand where I'm coming from, what would you suggest ?

Am I going about learning computer science in a wrong manner?

 I don't want to give up on my dream as I've already applied to take it at university (UK student ) and I am currently studying computer science at a lower level in college

My younger brother just started the program at the university, and I feel like he is being shortchanged a bit. I see the argument as Python has less of a barrier to entry. 

If you know both C++ and Python, which one did you learn first? In hindsight would you have switched the order you learned them? Does only learning Python make you miss out the things learning a lower level language can teach you?

People call C functions from Python, then process it further in Python, then call some other libraries, possibly again in Python that also look at gigantic data arrays.

&#x200B;

Isn't this an extremely inefficient way of doing things? Python is much slower than C++. How can it make sense to use Python in situations when large data is processed, performance-wise?

&#x200B;

One company asked me the question ""How to bind a C-function to Python that computes a 1GB floating-point array, and then to compute a total of all numbers in Python?"" They ask this question from the position when they assume that the use of Python is totally normal, and one should do such things as computing a 1GB fp array in C, then copying it into a gigantic Python list, then computing a total of numbers in Python. But this question in itself assumes that things are done extremely inefficiently, isn't it? They are just indoctrinated and think that things that they do are normal when they are far from normal.

&#x200B;

So why is Python used so widely, as opposed to using C++, for example? Is this because many people feel that Python is much easier and C++ is too hard?",1565338043

I thought it would be cool to do this with some other people as well (probably remotely). If any money is made from the application I was planning on donating it to a local non-profit.

I plan on working 60-80 hours a week on it in order to get it to a production level state but I wouldn't expect anyone else to do the same. Something closer to 5-10 hours a week would probably suffice.

Or if you could offer guidance through the process that would be great too. I am currently in college (4th year with two 6 month internships) and just want to get better

FAQ:

1. What is the tech stack?

\* That will depend on the project. Based on the project the tech stack that makes the most sense based on the research that is made will be the one that is used

2. What will the project be?\* We will brainstorm ideas based on the interviews that are done with businesses/residents in the first week

It's been a bit I posted a thread stating I am exhausted to do anything.

I am actually an international student, but have a citizenship that I am not part of the international students department. But I grew up outside the us where English isn't the first language. I came here when I was 19 by myself, and went to CC with health related major but in the last moment before getting nursing school, I changed my major to a complete different major. (I won't share the details since privacy...) During my CC, I took longer to transfer because the school required me to take ESL classes since English isn't my first language..But that was totally fine with me. I always wanted to study here and I was just living my dream at school.

However.... outside of the CC time, it was absolutely horrible.. I cannot mention details about it but it actually made me ended up in a psych unit that my family actually have to fly all the way to here to discharge me, since only family members could get me out. Then I went back to my country dropping all the classes except the online ones, and spent the rest of the semester with my family. 

During that horrible time before ending up in a psych unit, I actually lost all my happiness (before my friends and families always told me that I look like I never had a hard time because I am always nice positive smiley girl) I actually don't remember when I actually was happy laughing ever since psych unit.. 

After coming back from my country, I took the last requirements at my cc but had another horrible time that one of the professors harassed me in an inappropriate way. I reported to school after talking with one of my lab teachers and school eventually wiped the record of taking that class from my record and I was dropped from his class. The school explained things to CSUF and the class isn't really a must class for transfer that I should be fine. However, it's a main basic stream class? to my major, meaning it delayed my graduation at CSUF. 

I transferred with 4.0 GPA and hoping for amazing school year since CSUF is one of the schools as I really wanted to go as I heard the professors care more about students than the professors at UCs. (The reason why I didn't choose UC to go, I had to take more classes since it requires more than CSUs.)

But now I realize that I didn't in the past, I wasn't taking care of my trauma, that my moods would swing rapidly up and down. My boyfriend who was by me the whole time when I go through things, told me to see a doctor but I refused, since that horrible time was over and thought time would heal it. However, it actually just got worse and worse to the point I couldn't take care of myself. I would even be really anxious when my boyfriend isn't around who is not really able to come see me everyday since his work is here and there and he lives an hour away. Lost story short, I eventually went to the doctor but it took 2 years from the incidents of horrible time to get the treatment. 

In the beginning I was finally able to sleep and get back on studying that I actually love to do. However, the person who provided the horrible time was still connected to me even though I tried to get away, that still gave me hard time occasionally. I didn't face the person, but actually my boyfriend is connected to the person but he cannot get away from the person for reason I understand in my head. So I just try not to think about the person... 

However, as semester goes study load was getting heavier than ever and my gpa is just on a stiff downhill from 4.0, and stress piling up to the point my meds do not work anymore. and the last post I posted when I was feeling everything was just nothing. 

I don't really share my feelings or any of my life events to my families and friends, except my bf that he knows everything and he is the only one I trust. So what they see in me is probably the way I described myself in the post.. 

What I really meant in the post at the time when I was writing the post I actually wanted to see what people would see me from the outside.. since I don't share any details of my life to anyone except my boyfriend, I was a little afraid. But I got a lot of positive comments encouraging me and I just want to thank you to who commented.. I actually cried for hours after reading a negative comment I am being a baby and have been in my parent's arms for too long when I am actually alone without any family members here.. I know the person didn't know the details but since my friends don't really know my family isn't here it felt like maybe my friends are looking at me as a spoiled brat.. (The only thing they see is me being in the middle; like I don't know how to say, but mostly they would be hey what's up are you okay and I would only respond with I am okay and don't talk much..)

I don't know why I am writing all this, but my doctor is going to me give me evaluations tomorrow for more care... just wanted to take something off my mind before tomorrow.. If you read this much, I really appreciate it and thank you for your time reading it... 

&#x200B;

The internship I was interested in required, among other things, skill in C or C++. In some other job listings I've seen on Stack Overflow or LinkedIn ask for experience in C++ or some other language like Java or Python. 



I already am proficient with Java and Python, and very comfortable with Swift, but I was wondering if it is worth it as a computer scientist to learn C and C++ and their low-level memory management techniques. From what I gleaned on wikipedia, C++ is just an amalgamation of *too* many features, and C++ programmers just use a subsets of the language in practice. From this perspective, learning C++ when I already know some other languages seems optional and not very useful.

Many of you know or remember me, especially recently since the MtGox bankruptcy has been allegedly linked with Bitcoin price drops in December 2017 to February 2018. Since taking over the most active Bitcoin exchange in 2011, I ran MtGox until filing for civil rehabilitation on February 28th 2014 (which became bankruptcy less than 2 months later) because a large amount of Bitcoins went missing. Since then, four years have passed, and MtGox is still in bankruptcy today. I’ve been arrested, released under bail after a little less than one year, and am now trying to assist MtGox getting into civil rehabilitation.

I did my best trying to grow the ecosystem by running the biggest exchange at the time. It had big problems but still managed to hang in there. For a while. A quite long while, even, while the rest of the ecosystem caught up. At the end of the day, the methods I chose to try to get MtGox out of its trouble ended up being insufficient, insufficiently executed, or plain wrong.

I know I didn't handle the last, stressful days of the outdrawn and painful Gox collapse very well. I can only be humble about that in hindsight. Once again, I’m sorry.

Japanese bankruptcy law has a particularly nasty outcome here, and I want to address this up front. As creditors claims were registered, those claims were registered in the valuation of Japanese Yen on the bankruptcy date. That's the only way Japanese bankruptcy law can work (most bankruptcy laws around the world operate this way for that matter). This means that the claims can be paid back in full, and there will still be over 160,000 bitcoin and bitcoin cash in assets in the Gox estate. The way bankruptcy law works is that if there are any assets remaining after the creditors have been paid in full, then those assets are distributed to shareholders as part of the liquidation.

That's the only way any bankruptcy law can reasonably work. And yet, in this case, it produces an egregiously distasteful outcome in that the shareholders of MtGox would walk away with the value of over 160,000 bitcoin as a result of what happened.

I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen. One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen. I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.

I’m an engineer at heart. I want to build things. I like seeing what I build being useful, and people being happy using what I build. My drive, from day one, has been to push the limits of what is technically possible, and this is the main reason I liked and have been involved with Bitcoin in the first place. When I took over MtGox, I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.

Hopefully, I can make what I’ve learned in this experience useful to the community as a whole, so there can at least be something positive in the end.

Ask me anything you like.

**EDIT**: With this coming to r/all there have been an overwhelming number of messages, questions etc. I will continue responding for a little while but probably won't be able to respond to new questions (it is starting to be late here and I've been spending the last few hours typing).

The coronavirus shutdown is hammering supply and demand across the globe. That has forced the real economy into a sharp recession and triggered a rolling financial crisis. Below is a primer on one key piece of this mess: the crisis in corporate debt markets. This branch of finance is vitally important because even healthy companies often need access to credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

In 2008, the vector of crisis ran from mortgage-backed securities to the rest of the financial sector and then to the real economy. This time, the real economy is being hit directly, and the damage is reverberating back into financial markets.  The failing markets, in feedback-loop fashion, further threaten the real economy as corporations find it harder to borrow. As the corporate debt markets sour, major companies will go bankrupt. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Some analysts expect the economy to contract by an annualized rate of 30 percent during the second quarter of 2020.

Already, US financial markets are on public life support. The Federal Reserve has committed to unlimited purchases of all sorts of assets: US Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, car loans, municipal debts, and, in a historic step, both short term and long-term corporate debt. But the crisis will require more than a financial rescue.

The key political question now is: What sort of controls will come with the state intervention? Corporate greed and self-dealing need to be checked not merely in the name of fairness but also to make sure public bailout money is actually invested in the real economy rather than just gambled away, as it was after the 2008 crash and rescue.

###The Rise of Corporate Debt

Since 2008, household debt levels have actually declined and are now lower than they were going into the last crash. But not corporate debt. Measured as a firm’s “net debt” compared to its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), corporate debt has doubled since the last crash. In 2009, the average American company owed $2 of debt for every $1 in earnings. Today, the average firm carries net debt to EBITDA of 3 to 1, and many firms — like Ford Motor, CarMax, Harley-Davidson, and General Motors — carry ratios ranging from 8 to 1, to as high as 15 to 1. Boeing, a special case because of its 737 MAX crisis, carries a ratio of 37 to 1.

Over the last two decades, corporate America’s credit rating has collapsed. In the early ’90s, more than sixty companies held AAA credit ratings. Today, only two US firms are AAA rated: Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. In 2001, fewer than one in five “investment-grade” firms were rated BBB. Today half of all investment-grade corporate debt belongs to firms rated “triple-B” (BBB) or lower. A third of those firms are rated triple-B minus (BBB-), one notch away from speculative or “junk” status.

Already many triple-B-rated corporate bonds are trading on secondary markets at unusually low prices and high yields, often above 5 percent; that means even “investment grade” bonds are being treated as junk. Soon many triple-B-rated corporations will be formally downgraded to junk. That will drive up their borrowing costs and restrict their access to credit. Even healthy companies often need access to ready credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

The rating agency Moody’s estimates the default rate for “speculative-grade” debt — companies with ratings lower than Baa from Moody’s Investors Service, or a rating lower than BBB from Standard & Poor’s — might reach 10 percent this year, up from 2.3 percent last year. The consequences of all this will reverberate throughout the wider economy, deepening and extending the recession.

Total global corporate debt, including bonds and loans, is approximately $66 trillion; more than double what it was a decade ago. For comparison, the combined gross national product of all economies was estimated at $80.27 trillion in 2017. About a quarter of that is the US economy.

###What They Did With the Money

After the 2008 crash, the world’s central banks, with the US Federal Reserve in the lead, spent the next decade pushing money into the financial markets by way of super-low interest rates and the direct public purchase of financial assets from the private sector via quantitative easing (QE).

The cheap credit encouraged lots of corporate borrowing in the form of loans from banks and massive issuance of corporate bonds. Unlike loans, which can be routinely extended, or sometimes abruptly terminated, or have interest rates that float up and down, corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by a company committing to repay borrowed money on a specified schedule at a specified, usually fixed, rate of interest.

Corporations have been borrowing for a variety of reasons that range from shrewd arbitrage to stupid and reckless asset stripping. For a struggling and unprofitable company, for example JCPenney, debt can be a lifeline. For a profitable firm, borrowing money can be a way to raise capital without diluting existing shareholders’ claim on the company’s profits, which would happen if the firm issued stock.

Even some profitable firms with piles of cash borrowed rather than spend their cash, in part for the firepower effect: letting other competitors and market entrants know that the firm has enough money on hand to buy out any threatening start-ups, and showing the world the firm is ready to ride out any economic crisis.

Some firms used their borrowed money to buy other firms. This helped fuel a post-2008 wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Deloitte reported “more than $10 trillion in [M&A] domestic transactions since 2013.” Targeted companies borrowed to stockpile cash as a defense against such takeovers.

Firms also borrowed to fund CEO compensation, distributions to investors via dividends, and stock buybacks. Companies buy back their own stock so as to boost its price. A rising stock price is useful in many ways: it can keep away hostile raiders by making a targeted company too expensive to take over, but it can also draw in friendly suitors because (with some creative accounting) a rising stock value can make a weak firm appear more profitable. Corporate executives like a rising stock price because compensation packages are both tied to stock performance and almost always include some payment in company stock, so the higher the stock price, the higher the executives’ payout.

Sometimes, firms even invested their borrowed money in actual production. The capital-intensive oil and gas industry did that, but as we explain below, it still faces a crisis, perhaps more salient than other sectors.

###Bad Credit as Perverse Incentive

The end result of all the borrowing was declining corporate credit-worthiness: corporate debt soon badly outpaced their earnings growth and cash balances. This led to widespread credit-rating downgrades.

Perversely, lower credit ratings did not slow the borrowing binge, but rather spurred on further lending and borrowing, because as corporate credit ratings slipped, the interest rate that the downgraded firms had to pay on their loans and bonds increased. And, thus, so too did the lenders’ profits.

Corporate debt and stock prices entered into a twisted dialectic, each driving the other. As the stock market continued to inflate over the last decade, it provided the confidence investors required to continue their purchases of risky corporate bonds.

Keep in mind that many of the lending banks and asset funds were actually or essentially borrowing from Uncle Sam at inflation-adjusted rates close to zero, then lending to companies with triple-B and triple-B minus ratings at 5 percent interest. Profits like that meant there were always banks and asset funds eager to lend to debt-burdened corporations.

Investors could directly purchase specific corporations’ bonds, or, as is more often the case, invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target an array of corporate bonds. High-risk loans were also sliced and diced and repackaged into bundles called “collateralized loan obligations” (CLOs), a class of securities backed by an underlying portfolio of corporate loans.

According to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the majority of American CLOs are held by US institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual funds, and depository institutions. This means that when the debt is unable to be serviced, the pain will be absorbed within the US economy, much of it by the unassuming customers of these financial behemoths.

As was the case with the mortgage-backed securities of the 2008 crash, these funds helped “distribute risk” and thus gave an appearance of safety. The logic was that owning 1 percent of a hundred different loans would be safer, even if some loans went bad, than owning the entirety of a single debt security. The logic is not entirely wrong. And that is part of the problem: it encouraged yet more lending. As long as the economic forecast was optimistic, there was no reason for the debt spree to let up.

###Zombies and Others

Corporate debt, like much of the economy, is a story of disparities. Not every corporation is burdened by debt. Some firms are actually awash in cash. Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet Inc, and Apple each sit on more than $100 billion in cash. As a whole, corporate America has been sitting on record amounts of cash in recent years. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley Investment Management estimates that one in six US companies cannot cover even the interest payments on their debts.

At the heart of the problem are “leveraged loans” and so-called zombie firms. Leveraged loans are a type of expensive, high-risk credit extended to already heavily indebted companies. Since the 2008 crash, the leveraged loan market has doubled to $1.2 trillion. Now, leveraged loans in the United States are being re-sold at only 84 cents on the dollar, their lowest price since August 2009. The majority of leveraged loans — more than half — are in the form of the aforementioned CLOs. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there were $617 billion of CLOs outstanding.

Zombie firms are defined by the Bank for International Settlements as heavily indebted, well-established companies that have failed to be profitable over an extended period and have low expected profitability in the future. In other words, heavily indebted start-ups do not qualify as zombies. The most threatened sectors are energy, automotive, insurance, capital goods (meaning equipment and machinery), telecoms, aerospace and defense, and some parts of retail.

The bull market of rising, often overvalued, stock prices allowed many uncompetitive and unprofitable companies to appear healthy based solely on their stock’s performance. Even before the markets started to crash on March 9, some analysts were prescient enough to call the market’s bluff at the beginning of the year.

But in this rapidly developing crisis, firms all across the economy may soon find it impossible to meet their liabilities. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains and forcing massive constrictions in consumer demand, corporate earnings are contracting fast, which in turn will badly hurt corporate debt servicing.

Like a hypertrophied organ rupturing, the putrefaction of unsustainable corporate debt now threatens to create a generalized economic sepsis that will hurt even healthy firms.

###Profiles in Debt

Airlines. The top six major US airlines spent enormous sums to buy back their stock over the last decade. US airlines (as a whole) spent 96 percent of their borrowed money on buying back stock. Now, revenue from flights is plummeting. United Airlines’ bookings have fallen by 70 percent. Back in 2011, American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $29 billion in liabilities; today, they have over $34 billion in debt. Yields on some of their bonds reached a whopping 12 percent, a particularly distressing sign as interest rates have been slashed by the Fed in an effort to relieve credit markets.

Energy. Even before the effects of coronavirus eviscerated demand for fossil fuels, US energy companies were suffering due to high fixed costs and low energy prices. In the last five years, 208 US energy companies have declared bankruptcy. Energy prices have been pushed down by the fracking revolution, the rise of renewable energy, and oil overproduction due to struggles between large producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.

Now the coronavirus shock is pushing firms over the edge. Occidental Petroleum — which has $40 billion in debt, while its market value (the value of all of its stocks combined) is less than $11 billion — recently had its debt downgraded to junk.

Energy mutual funds reveal the crisis in the energy sector as a whole. Vanguard Energy Fund, considered one of the top four oil mutual funds, has lost over 41 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Of course, the biggest oil companies, the “Oil Majors” (such as BP, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) have enough resources, market power, and government support to survive the crisis. But the effects on the less established firms stretch beyond the energy industry itself.

Lenders. As the oil and gas firms go into crisis, the banks that extended them credit may also face defaults. Loans outstanding to the petroleum sector from regional banks in North America exceed $100 billion. Banks financing oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma saw their share prices drop nearly 30 percent. In oil-dependent states, public budgets will hurt as tax revenues decline sharply.

Retail. A number of important retailers carry net debt to EBITDA ratios that are too high to be sustainable under current conditions. For example, Rite Aid owes $15.80 for every dollar it earns. For JCPenney, the ratio is $8.30 to $1; for Walgreens Boots Alliance, it is $5.80 to $1. Office Depot owes $4.60 compared to every dollar earned.

###Beyond Bailout

Bailing out distressed companies, even taking them under public ownership for a while, may staunch the bleeding. And the bubble can eventually be reinflated with enough effort. But a replay of the 2008 bailout, which involved lots of public money but very little public regulation and planning, will only mean a long slump followed by a bubble for the rich.

The American economy is a sick beast. It needs not only government handouts and ownership — which it is getting — it also needs planning.

Oil, airlines, and cruise ships — these are high-emission industries that, in the face of climate crisis, must be radically transformed or cease to exist. With government ownership and planning, these industries could be unwound and their resources redeployed.

Although COVID-19 set off our current recession, it was the indulgence of the 1 percent built into the 2008 rescue that is responsible for the depth and severity of our current economic crisis. Without guidance, money was poured into the financial system. Not surprisingly, it blossomed alongside the mutually reinforcing dynamic of artificially inflated stock prices and ballooning corporate debt.

Capitulation to the gluttony of financiers is deeply unjust. But it is also unworkable in purely technical terms. Without constraints on greed, there will be another bubble and crash and a longer slump, more suffering, greater inequality, and more social instability. We have to force government to use its legal and financial power to steer the American economy toward more egalitarian, socially rational, and environmentally sustainable purposes. We have to make this bailout work for the majority of us.

#Corporate Socialism: The Government is Bailing Out Investors & Managers Not You


The U.S. government is enacting measures to save the airlines, Boeing, and similarly affected corporations. While we clearly insist that these companies must be saved, there may be ethical, economic, and structural problems associated with the details of the execution. As a matter of fact, if you study the history of bailouts, there will be.



The bailouts of 2008–9 saved the banks (but mostly the bankers), thanks to the execution by then-treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who fought for bank executives against both Congress and some other members of the Obama administration. Bankers who lost more money than ever earned in the history of banking, received the largest bonus pool in the history of banking less than two years later, in 2010. And, suspiciously, only a few years later, Geithner received a highly paid position in the finance industry.

That was a blatant case of corporate socialism and a reward to an industry whose managers are stopped out by the taxpayer. The asymmetry (moral hazard) and what we call optionality for the bankers can be expressed as follows: heads and the bankers win, tails and the taxpayer loses. Furthermore, this does not count the policy of quantitative easing that went to inflate asset values and increased inequality by benefiting the super rich. Remember that bailouts come with printed money, which effectively deflate the wages of the middle class in relation to asset values such as 
ultra-luxury apartments in New York City.

The Generalized Bob Rubin Trade: Keep the profits, transfer losses to taxpayers. Named after Bob Rubin who pocketed 120 million dollars from Citi but claimed uncertainty and kept past bonuses. This encourages anyone to never be insured for such eventualities since the government will pick up the tab.

####If It’s Bailed Out, It’s a Utility

First, we must not conflate airlines as a physical company with the financial structure involved. Nor should we conflate the fate of the employees of the airlines with the unemployment of our fellow citizens, which can be directly compensated rather than indirectly via leftovers of corporate subsidies. We should learn from the Geithner episode that bailing out individuals based on their needs is not the same as bailing out corporations based on our need for them.

Saving an airline, therefore, should not equate to subsidizing their shareholders and highly compensated managers and promote additional moral hazard in society. For the very fact that we are saving airlines indicates their role as utility. And if as such they are necessary for society, then why do their managers have optionality? Are civil servants on a bonus scheme? The same argument must also be made, by extension, against indirectly bailing out the pools of capital, like hedge funds and endless investment strategies, that are so exposed to these assets; they have no honest risk mitigation strategy, other than a trained naïve reliance on bailouts or what’s called in the industry the “government put”.

Second, these corporations are lobbying for bailouts, which they will eventually get thanks to the pressure they can exert on the government via lobby units. But how about the small corner restaurant ? The independent tour guide ? The personal trainer? The massage professional? The barber? The hotdog vendor living from tourists near the Met Museum ? These groups cannot afford lobbyists and will be ignored.

####Buffers Not Debt

Third, as we have been warning since 2006, companies need buffers to face uncertainty –not debt (an inverse buffer), but buffers. Mother nature gave us two kidneys when we only need about a portion of a single one. Why? Because of contingency. We do not need to predict specific adverse events to know that a buffer is a must. Which brings us to the buyback problem. Why should we spend taxpayer money to bailout companies who spent their cash (and often even borrowed to generate that cash) to buy their own stock (so the CEO gets optionality), instead of building a rainy day buffer? Such bailouts punish those who acted conservatively and harms them in the long run, favoring the fool and the rent-seeker.

####Not a Black Swan

Furthermore, some people claim that the pandemic is a “Black Swan”, hence something unexpected so not planning for it is excusable. The book they commonly cite is The Black Swan. Had they read that book, they would have known that such a global pandemic is explicitly presented there as a white swan: something that would eventually take place with great certainty. Such acute pandemic is unavoidable, the result of the structure of the modern world; and its economic consequences would be compounded because of the increased connectivity and overoptimization. As a matter of fact, the government of Singapore, whom we advised in the past, was prepared for such an eventuality with a precise plan since as early as 2010.

First of all, yes. Not going to class right now would ease a lot of people's stress about the virus, and being stressed (like most college students already are) leads to a lowered immune system, putting us all at more of a risk of being affected by the disease.

But second of all, there are some legitimate reasons for us to be concerned. My grandparents recently traveled from India, to London, and finally to LAX and at no point in their travels were they asked any questions about symptoms, where they were traveling to and from, and if they were running a temperature. They were traveling during the first few weeks in March. Although they did not go to any of the areas that are currently being impacted by the Corona Virus, they were being exposed in the airport to many people who could have potentially be carriers of the virus while being asymptomatic. Waiting until a case shows up and tests positive will mean we are already too late and many people will have already been exposed and the cycle will continue.

Now how does this pertain to all of us? We are a commuter college that brings in students from all over California. Although there is no one who has been infected yet (knock on wood) our college and others like it would be an epicenter for the illness to spread all over California.

I am not saying we should cancel classes altogether, but the idea of transitioning them to being accessible online would greatly diminish the possibility of the illness being spread to our loved ones and teachers to whom it would affect in a more negative way. As young students, we are able to fight this illness off more effectively than our parents or grandparents, so as much as I want to say that the students are my number one priority, that is just not the case. My main concern is parents, grandparents, and even our professors, many of whom are much older and the disease would have a much more significant impact on.

Transitioning classes to an online format would also reduce stress on those who are already sick and don't come to class because they do not want their sickness to spread. In general, it should be much easier to get classwork and notes directly from our professors when we are sick and using an online format as well as ""zoom"" would provide for that.

Now for those who are worried about the possibility of graduation being canceled. There is a much better chance that graduation will not be canceled if we do close down the campus for a little while. Graduation will absolutely be canceled if this gets any more serious, so closing down campus now actually means there is a better chance at graduation taking place. Closing down campus as soon as possible would prevent the disease from spreading around campus and allow for it to die out or a vaccine to be created by the time graduation rolls around. But if we continue to hold classes and someone does get infected, there is no way to tell just how many people it will affect and for how long.

I hope you read this entire thing before taking to the comments and getting angry at me, but if there is anything I missed or anything I got wrong, please let me know. Right now the world needs more kindness and compassion, not hate or ignorance. Lets continue to work together as a cohesive student body to make our voices heard.

I will be e-mailing a similar version of this to our school's president, Framroze Virjee, and I suggest you do the same if you have similar concerns about the virus and our campus.

EDIT: Thank you for the fantastic response. I really love the discussion this has opened up. Honestly, I was afraid to post because I was worried about backlash.

My background is a law degree, but I have found a great interest in technology and programming when I started to learn Java as a hobby. As I learn more, I realise that the circle of 'what I need to know to be effective' grows ever wider. For me, it is insufficient simply to understand how to write a loop, or a method etc.

There seems to be a vast amount of CS which is not simply 'programming' which I am missing out on by only studying a language. A few of these topics I have seen are Data Structures, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Networking, and even 'How a computer works!!!'

I feel that a broader knowledge would help me understand better exactly what I am doing, and all of the jargon which honestly goes over my head. 

So, my request: is there a list of recommended topics for general understanding of computers, computer science, and, following on from that, a reading list you would recommend for each topic that is suitable for self study for a beginner?

Many thanks in advance. ",1517249819

I was researching summer/winter classes (and how to pay for them) earlier today, trying to put together a plan that'll have me graduate on time and all. Anyway, in my research I came across the link. Is this free online class in addition to the potential 18 credits we are allowed to take per semester? So, 21 in total (assuming the online class is 3 credits)? Also, it says 1 free class per semester or quarter. I know CSUF has semesters, not quarters, but they technically do offer summer and winter sessions. So would this be 1 free class per session, basically 4 free classes a year? What's your experience with it?

This is a summary of what was answered by the dean:

**COVID19 Grades**

\- No decision made but talks are happening and there's a very high probability that students will have the **option** for credit/no credit

**Why does the college not list faculty names for class registration**

\- ECS offers a very limited number of sections for each class compared to other colleges on campus, so they have less flexibility. Takes time to track student demand and make decisions on number of sections offered and schedules for those classes. The department doesn't finalize schedules until a few weeks before class. The decision was made to prioritize flexibility to respond to student demand and moving parts involved with course scheduling.

**Virtual Advising**

\- Information available at  [http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/ecs-updates.php](http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/ecs-updates.php)

**Summer Classes**

\- Summer classes are online only, almost all classes will be 5 weeks long. Department chairs get to decide how labs work

**Senior Design Projects**

\- Contact your instructor if you have questions

**International Students**

\- Contact international students office

**Internships/On/off-campus jobs over summer**

\- Contact career center, ECS specialist is Paula Verdugo

**On campus lab usage**

\- Not available at this time

**Issues with a specific professor**

\- Contact department chair

**Tuition pricing or financial assistance**

\- There are ongoing talks regarding student fees, nothing regarding tuition. Normal resources (scholarships and such) available for financial assistance

**Is the machine shop open to students**

\- No

**EPP over summer**

\- No, might be offered at the end of this semester, will be offered at the start of fall semester.",1586413384

I'd give the overall experience a 5/10.

Little background about me. I started a double major Business and Law, but never really liked it all that much. So I finished that but never actually got around to working in that specific field. I got really depressed about my lack of perspectives for quite a while (year and a half). After my mental health got a little better, I started to look for jobs that may interest me.

I always had the entrepreneurial ""what if"" in my brain, and always looked up to coders. It seemed so cool and challenging from the outside. I started getting my head into it a little bit, but felt very overwhelmed. I did not really know where to start or what steps to follow. That's when I read about the whole bootcamp thing happening in the US. I read both good and bad opinions about them, so I decided to try for myself.

First of all, I'm from Spain, so my experience has happened here in Madrid, where IMO the saturation of these has not arrived yet.

Anyway, the bootcamp itself provided a warranty of 100% employment, so I said ""well, that's good"" and enrolled. The duration was 3 months. I told myself ""so 100% employment after a 3-month course? That's great!"".

The whole thing started with a ""review"" of an online course they made us do on HTML and CSS, and that lasted around a week. After that we went straight into vanilla JS, and right after that, they taught us Angular. In terms of front-end we were also taught Bootstrap, SASS and Semantic. Then the back end part arrived, to my surprise only when we were 3 weeks from finishing. They just went really fast with MySQL, NodeJS, MongoDB. Finally they shoewed us a bit of the framework Ionic, for mobile development, so we could get a glimpse of what developing for a cellphone would look like.

The whole thing had to end with a full-stack project, which needless to say, did by myself with the help of internet resources.


So, my opinion. It's just too much stuff for a 3 month period. You end up just barely knowing the stuff, and becoming a master of none. I've been asked in telephone interviews what my experience was, and it just seemed stupid when I'd tell them everything I've just told you in this post. Had they asked me anything in particular about those technologies I'd have probably fainted.

Now I'm just skeptic as to what my job prospects are, at least as my first position. They did sign a contract with the 100% employment thing.

Overall, I've found Udemy and personal projects to be the best source of learning. In terms of books, I've only been able to read ""Javascript: from novice to ninja"" and it's been of great help.

I belive that it is essential to master the basics of programming itself since those will always be the foundation of any programming language, and I've only found that out myself. The first JS class was like ""OK. So JS is programming language which uses variables to..."" and I was like ""mmm... ok. Give me a little background here?"".

I don't know. I'm a little disappointed in myself for believeing that I'd know my shit after 3 months. Now I'm considering the idea of getting into CS degree at 25 years old. It's never late, and I really like the field, but I think it'd be better for me to learn everything from scratch.

Hope this helped to those who are considering the idea of joining a coding bootcamp. The Internet is your friend, and bootcamps nowadays don't give you much of a credential. Luckily, in this field it's all about experience,and not certificates. Despite all that, I'd really like to get into the degree. I feel like that's my true call.

Thanks for reading and best of luck.",1544203365

Me and my friend have been given an assignment in our Computer Science course at uni to give a short presentation (\~15 minutes) about Surveillance Capitalism. We have largely based the explaining about what it is from either Shoshana Zuboffs book ""The age of Surveillance Capitalism"" and different articles regarding the issue, and it can most easily be explained as: 

""Surveillance capitalism describes a market-driven process where the commodity for sale is your personal data, and the capture and production of this data relies on mass surveillance of the internet. This activity is often carried out by companies that provide us with free online services, such as search engines and social media platforms.""

In the last part of our presentation, we are to give our predictions for how this process will develop in the future. It can focus on things like how states/countries/unions might legislate and regulate to keep it under control (i.e. GDPR in the European Union) or how companies can develop more sophisticated methods to extract and sell the data more efficiently.  

My question is what you guys might think about future development regarding this issue? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",1583170734

As a computer science student it's very easy to get confused by something. No matter if it is simple discreet math problem or just setting up appropriate ecosystem for coding. I am just a sophomore who sometimes struggles with basic things, if not this(not only reddit) helpful community who knowns where i would ended up.

Today's little event made me realize that this healthy community is the reason why computer science, which is very new field compared to other sciences, has evolved so dramatically fast and now have huge impact on almost everything. 

I am going to start Stanford's 'Programming Paradigms' from SEE and could not set up an environment on Unix. I was stuck badly and decided to write to lecturer who teaches the course. I wasn't expected him to answer my questions at all.... I mean, i'm just a guy from another end of the world having absolutely nothing to do with Stanford. In my suprise he took time and gave me detailed explanation to everything. I cannot even believe that i recieved mail someone like him. I'm still in shock.

This made me feel like i was a member of a big community where everyone is willing to help as much as possible, no matter who you are or where you are.

Just wanted to thank to all of you who did similar things to others!! This little things really make difference!

Bes of luck to everyone.",1547612295

I'm a normal CS student at some university.  I first entered to programming world through iOS development in 11th grade.  I didn't do much after developing one super simple app that didn't even get to App Store.  Then I found out that there's a major dedicated to programming and related subjects so I applied and got into CS.  

From school, I learned data structures, system programming, and data science, AI, and all those things that you would learn from usual CS courses.  For my side projects, I tried booting up an Ubuntu server on a machine and wrote simple scripts that would use APIs of various services on it.

All of these were fun.  However, they were not fun enough to stop me from watching TV shows, reading comics, or reading Facebook posts (these are my time-killing hobbies).  I'm not sure whether this is a matter of me not fully accepting the fact that programming could be a really enjoyable hobby or the nature of programming itself, or something else.

One thing that's working out well is that I'm following many software companies and programming community pages on Facebook, and I get a lot of exposure to some great blog posts and news articles about software and related topics, and I really like reading them.

Finally, my point is that I want to really feel that geeky vibe.  I want to fall in love with programming.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with playing games, watching TV shows, cooking, and etc, but regardless of what I learn from school, I want to make my relationship with programming as something that resembles my relationship with my hobbies.  Since I will be learning technical sides of programming from school and online, I really want to learn how to love programming, how to make that mindset.

Just to make sure, this is not about what kind of projects I should do in order to utilize what I learned.  It's more about for those of you who actually say my hobby is programming, why is it and how did that happen, what were some triggering moments that you feel that programming is so much fun?

Any suggestion would be much appreciated.",1520663301

Hey everyone, new to the sub but it looks extremely promising. Tried looking for a pinned post for this but couldn't find anything. Recently have been doing some reading and listening to speakers at Davos and more and more it seems like AI and Machine Learning are going to be the world's next greatest technological advancement with unprecedented ramifications across any and all aspects of life.

At the moment, I'm a only Political Science student who has only spoke/learned about AI from a policy standpoint. However, even then it seems that without a technical understanding of these concepts it's almost impossible to begin to think about how to legislate such technologies. In a similar vein, I've also become very interested in learning more about both of these concepts, but it seems like most CompSci and CIS grad programs require a STEM undergrad or some prior exposure to the field. Am i out of luck or are there ""bridge"" programs for CIS/CompSci? Thanks for your help!",1579835167

I announced it on reddit previously... and here it is.

&#x200B;

First of all it was shocking how many messages we had over such a long time... and it was very interesting to see the patterns occuring.

Next, I trained a bot for several nights (+ experimentation) that in the end does pretty well!

From the video you can see that it doesn't take the ""current time"" into account, which actually turned out to be its biggest flaw, lol (no spoilers)!

&#x200B;

Anyway, writing the ""facebook driver"" with selenium was fun too.

What turned out to be an interesting part of the model is that it had to split up a message into more messages (there's a difference between a newline and a new bubble), which I represented as a special character in my data.

The other way too - I had to make sure it did not reply to every message individually, but instead I had it wait some time. It was considering messages starting with a capital letter as ""mobile"" (and allow a longer wait than non-mobile).

&#x200B;

Anyway, I hope you enjoy: [https://youtu.be/nzXt471bXmA](https://youtu.be/nzXt471bXmA)

Unfortunately the code is too sloppy to post on my github right now but in case you'd be interested I should maybe clean it and put it there.

Or perhaps just the facebook driver I wrote?",1560125104

Hundreds of questions and over two hours scheduled, and all we got was a few people telling us ""it depends"", and ""I don't know"" before congratulating themselves over and over again, and treating us to a president who can't stay composed during a time that is extremely trying for all of us—all while cutting the meeting almost 80 minutes short.  


Meanwhile, our ""student governance"" has essentially disappeared, enrollment is down 20% (according to one of my mentors who is a reputable source within MSBE), **we** are suffering, people are dying and getting sick. Many of us have had to completely (and in some cases, traumatically) shift our lives because of this, and they can't even sit through a 2 hour meeting to answer our questions?  


I understand that there is a lot going on behind the scenes, but it really stung to get my hopes for critical information up for a week only to be met with ""Thank you for that excellent answer"" and ""I'm so excited but we don't know"". I don't think that these are the people that should be leading us in this time of crisis, and if they haven't been able to step up right now, why should we expect them to step up after this passes?

A while ago, many people got together and asked the moderators to ban ""how do I do this?"" style posts on r/Python. The moderators listened, because this was a popular request; ""how do I do this?"" posts are subject to removal. We direct people towards r/LearnPython and to the [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python) (which is a great learning resource filled with great people, by the way, check it out). The fact that we remove these posts has made a number of people unhappy about things. 

The people who are most unhappy are (quite understandably) the people who have their questions removed. I've been told that people frequently feel like they do not get answers on r/LearnPython and that even when things are removed here, they get better answers.

The next most unhappy group are people who strongly feel like these questions should be removed, and that the moderators don't remove them quickly enough. That's a valid concern; we remove dozens every day, but there's frequently a question in the queue that people want to have answered.

The next most unhappy group is me. At one point, I actually took part in this subreddit in a reasonable way, but about 99% of what I do now is remove questions from people who want help, and who *may not receive that help*. Moderating is generally a pretty thankless job, and this is one that is especially disheartening because I don't really believe that removing these is particularly helpful.

## I propose an alternate solution

Something a number of subreddits do is to enforce a flair requirement for posts. There are a lot of benefits to this: it helps with searchability, filterability, organization (I realize that those are secretly all the same benefit, shhh).

I propose that we enforce flair requirements for all posts. To do this, we can use u/AssistantBOT. AssistantBOT helps by gently asking people to add flairs to their posts; for mobile users, you can reply to the bot, and the bot sets the flair for you. It also provides a monthly breakdown on the flairs that are used.

I've used this bot on other subreddits, and it helps out significantly. If everything is categorized, it is trivial to filter out or search for the things that you are interested in. If you want to track Python Official releases, there could be a flair for that; if you want to avoid ""Show and Tell"" style posts, you could filter that out. The bot is simple and easy to use and works with old reddit, new reddit, mobile reddit, and all the apps that I've come across.

Please let me know what you think in the comments.

## Maybe some clarification is in order

I want to clarify some things. If we go down this route, my suggestion is that whenever someone tags something with ""help"" text, then they would automatically get a message that explained the following:

* It's probably a better idea to try r/LearnPython and the Python Discord first because they're both about helping people. r/Python is **not a dedicated help forum**
* It's also a good idea to check StackOverflow
* Asking for help is a two way street. Don't post pictures of code, and don't expect people to do homework.

There are some [interesting suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bx3yn9/lets_talk_about_learning_posts/eq3pe70/) from u/flyinglotus123 - check them out too!

I also want to stipulate that this would be on a trial basis. If we stopped removing these things, and then the subreddit transitioned into mostly help questions, then we would revert. I think there would **necessarily** be a test period, and it might be worthwhile to have certain parts of the year (ie September) where we simply direct people to other places.",1559777835

4410,BEWXYUH2ENDGNW27AJKMUK9EF,EaFaer,Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/,"On November 28, 2017, the US Senate, Committee of the Judiciary held a hearing regarding bill S.1241: Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‘financial institution’ in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.

Bill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‘financial institution,’ in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include “an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” Currently, the definition of ‘financial institution’ includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.

In her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), “The bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.” Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‘financial institution’, it seems clear enough that the bill would “criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…

The US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What’s more, according to the hearing’s prolonged discussion of US law enforcement’s handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.

If the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of ‘financial institution’ in mind. If you’ve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‘banks and financial institutions’ with ‘digital currencies and digital exchanges.’ The implications are really rather alarming.

Interestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.

Conversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them “to conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.”

Also in her prior written testimony, she stated that “the FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns;” that “investigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide;” and that “of course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws.” Advertisement

Contrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.

Ms. Klobuchar (2:16:58):

“Is this transition we’re seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?”
Mr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):

“Senator, I’m just glad I had my career when I did because I don’t know what I’d do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it’s extremely, extremely challenging…I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That’s not to say it’s gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We’re right at a crossroads, and it’s going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.”
Due to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.

Furthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.

As Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.

Tone Vayes’ summation*: “It’s bad…I think it’s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin—even Bitcoin holders and users—and the US Government.”

Jimmy Song’s summation*: “Yeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long time…”

Indeed it will be “very, very interesting to see what goes forward.” If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?

*to be fair, neither had yet watched the entire hearing.

What can she do?",computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/9ah5k8/my_girlfriends_coworker_is_an_awful_coder_and/,"Hi guys. So everyone in this post (me, her, the coworker) is 20/21 and a junior in college. She works for a MechE lab doing computer science work, so her boss isn't much help because he doesn't know much of anything about CS. 

My girlfriend just started coding last year. When she started working at this job, she didn't know what OOP was. She's come a huge way in a short time and really has a knack for this stuff. I'm really proud of her because it can be hard to play catchup.

Anyways, onto this coworker. So since she is new to programming, he did most of the coding on their project at the beginning and she did most of the algorithm work. Now that she is in her junior year and knows what she's doing, she's been contributing more. She's thinking of submitting the project to a journal and writing a paper to go along with it, and has been looking back through the code to make sure it is journal ready. 

Her coworker's code is AWFUL. He also kept moving the code to his private repo instead of the lab repo (why?), overwriting her changes and he made over 200 commits in only a couple months (worth noting that this project only has like 3 files...wtf dude). She asked me to look it over because she wanted to refactor it and wanted to know if I had any input. I swear, she has to rewrite all of it. I'm not even being dramatic, the two paragraphs goes through what I mean but is totally skipable if you don't care, it's mostly me being sad about this code. 

So as part of their code they have two objects that I would assume would inherit from something. Like Shape --> triangle, square. He has one class, Shape. He has you pass the type (triangle vs square) into the constructor, then if type = triangle, declare one set of variables, otherwise, declare a different set. This class has two methods, one method for each type. If you call a method on the wrong type, it throws a runtime error. WHAT.

In the main code, he also iterates through a list AFTER clearing it. Why? He calls a function on each list item with the word ""get"" in the title. That function doesn't return anything, or use pass by reference. That function ALSO calls a ""get"" function that returns nothing and doesn't edit any values. Huh? 

So yes. The code is a mess and looking at it made me want to cry. No journal would ever accept this in the state it's in and she honestly needs to probably start from scratch. He didn't even follow the algorithm. This coworker though, thinks he is gods gift to the earth. He insists on having all the code on his private repo, instead of a lab repo where everyone has equal access. The prof even told him to have his code in the lab repo, but he moved it back to his! What! He doesn't comment or document properly, and whenever she tries to make (much needed) changes he commits and overwrites them. He also purposely leaves her out of email chains concerning the project (even though it was her project to begin with, and her idea), and talks to the professor behind her back. To the prof's credit, whenever he conveniently forgets to use the CC button he brings her back in, and the next reply she's out again. **Another thing - he doesn't even work at the lab anymore!!** She can't talk to her boss about him, because he's not his boss anymore! He told her and the prof that he ""doesn't have enough time"" to do the paper, and that she will have to do it on her own. **But he's still happily making changes to the repo (that he won't move off his account), usually like one line change / commit. My gf is already planning to do a total refactor of the code, but we're afraid that he'll just undo the changes**. My dad (in the CS industry for years) thinks we should talk to the prof and get the coworker kicked off the project, or fork the repo into the lab repo and ignore his changes from now on. My gf hates confrontation and thinks this is ""too aggressive"". I think that she should basically tell him to screw off, fork the repo without him being a contributor and redo the code properly from scratch. Like, he doesn't work there anymore, why is he making changes? 

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Is there anything short of forking the repo that she can do? ",1535332398

I remember staring at bitcoin a few years ago. When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I thought that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!

Today, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don't believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it 🍍 The Pineapple Fund.

Yes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)

So far, The Pineapple Fund has/is:

* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.

* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa

* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more

* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. 

If you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)

This is a problem I've faced multiple times. 

As someone with a couple of years of programming experience in multiple languages, most websites that teach you a new language do so in a painfully boring manner.

They all follow the same basic pattern - how to declare variables, constants, how to write for loops, switch cases, structs, and then the last 4-5 chapters are dedicated to meaty stuff like Goroutines and Channels.

A chapter about, say, variables, is full of obscure specific rules you're never going to remember, as someone looking at the book/website for the first time.

This makes learning a new language a very dry experience. I've lost interest in a new language, say Haskell or Erlang, multiple times, because by the time I mow through the first 5 chapters, all I've learned is declaring variables and functions, but all my interest has been sapped out, with repetitive examples like fibonacci and factorials.

I randomly stumbled upon exercism.io, and I found it really cool!

* They have problem sets for all languages
* They have a CLI tool, which means you can fetch exercises, and upload solutions without leaving your terminal, unlike say, codeforces
* I assume there is some sort of graded difficulty, because the couple of problems I tried were 2-4 liners
* They encourage a system, where people can check out each other's submissions and see different ways to achieve the same thing. They encourage you to participate, and leave comments/suggestions on other people's solutions. No one seems to care much for the easier problems, I'm not sure how good the community support is for the harder ones.
* The problems are not algorithmic in nature. With algorithmic problems - you're only using basic primitives like arrays, loops and recursion, but the examples here require you to understand and interact with various libraries that come with the language.

Apologies if this is a fairly well-known platform, but I just came across it, and found it the best way to learn a new language as an experienced programmer.

Here's the update.

**What's the same**: uses machine learning on wifi data to predict where you are indoors.

As can be seen on the [whereami github](https://github.com/kootenpv/whereami):

    # bash
    pip install whereami
    
    # in your bedroom, takes 100 samples
    whereami learn -l bedroom -n 100
    
    # in your kitchen, takes 100 samples
    whereami learn -l kitchen                  # default n=100
    
    # cross-validated accuracy on historic data
    whereami crossval
    # 0.99319
    
    # use in other applications, e.g. by piping the most likely answer:
    whereami predict | say
    # Computer Voice says: ""bedroom""
    
    # probabilities per class
    whereami predict_proba
    # {""bedroom"": 0.99, ""kitchen"": 0.01}

**What's new**

- Now cross-platform (OSX, Windows, Linux such as Ubuntu/Arch Linux)
- Spawned [access_points](https://github.com/kootenpv/accces_points) package in the process (just purely for scanning wifi)
- `whereami` now does not retrain a model before each prediction but only creates a model after new learning
- Big refactoring, allowing a simplified model with more power
- A model is now saved on disk in a way that allows API changes without affecting the model

Curious what you guys think :)

Please, don't say that. That's terrible mindset. It makes other people misunderstand. If you don't want to lose bitcoin before the price goes up, you just buy more bitcoin before or after you purchase something with bitcoin. Or sell your house for buying more bitcoin.

The real value of bitcoin depends on how many transactions that purchase with bitcoin. If nobody purchases anything with bitcoin, bitcoin will become worthless. Hodling or storing bitcoin never help the community anyway.

We have to promote trading bitcoin and purchasing with bitcoin.

I recommend purchasing with bitcoin at the store that discount when we paying with bitcoin. That's helping the store, help the community, and help the buyer at the same time.

Yeah, I agree with someone. We shouldn't use bitcoin in stores where it is more expensive and high fee. We shouldn't support this business model.

BUT, But, But Using bitcoin helps adoption which increases the price of bitcoin. We need the benefits of bitcoin just to persuade merchants to accept it by using it.

I love programming, but I also really love hip hop music.  I typically find this music by looking at a website called Hot New Hip Hop, which keeps a list of the top 100 new songs at any given time.  There are a select number of artists who I like, and a lot of the time the tracks are too new to be on Spotify.

To save myself time, I automated my process of searching for and discovering new music.  I used Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a script to run every morning, scrape the top 100 songs page, and add songs to a playlist if they're made by artists I like and are on Spotify.  I also used a SQLite database to store my Spotify client and access tokens, as well as prevent adding duplicate songs.  This script will probably save me about 45 minutes to an hour each week, which is pretty sweet.

I first got in around September of 2013 when the price was $130. I later set up a weekly buy on Coinbase buying the majority of my coins between $200 to $400. My original goal back then was to accumulate 21 BTC and be in the million club. I turned it off in 2015 once I was well over 21 coins. Of course looking back I wish I had never turned it off.

**So why did I sell?** The value is now enough that I can pay my capital gains and still have enough to pay off my house leaving me completely debt free. I found myself constantly stressing over the fact I was storing close to 200K and I also fully expect a pull back at some point soon. Once my house is paid off I will most likely start buying back in again using money that would have been going towards a house payment.

**Things I learned**  
**Test your recovery process.** If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.

**Store your seed securely.** I used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¼ inch steel plate. After that I dipped it in plastisol so it cannot be read and stored it in my safe with a description written on the outside. I also had another copy of the seed stored behind a picture at a trusted family member’s house just in case.

**Sending a BTC transaction for tens of thousands of dollars is extremely stressful.** I first moved my coins from Coinbase to a hardware wallet before the BCH fork (yes, I was stupid and stored them on an exchange, although I did use their cold storage feature so there was a waiting period before they could be moved if my account was compromised). It was a long 15 minutes before the transaction showed up on the blockchain (I think Coinbase batches transactions up before sending) so I was freaking out that I had done something wrong and all my coins were gone. I wanted to save on transaction fees, but I should have moved them in smaller increments.

**Weekly buys and dollar cost averaging is the way to buy.** I never had to think about the weekly buy so it was worth the small amount I paid for fees. Over time I was able to build a substantial sum.

**It takes a long time to get out due to limits.** I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason. I am pretty happy with Coinbase, but they are obviously dealing with growing pains. After withdrawing around 50K they quit letting me withdraw and said I needed to do some more verification. I tried uploading my license but the verification kept failing with a blank error message. I submitted a support ticket and heard nothing for several days. I finally remembered that they had recently added phone support so found the number and called. I only had to wait about 10 minutes until I talked to someone and they were very helpful. It turns out I was supposed to be prompted to use a web cam to take a selfie after uploading my license. Once I found that out I did it on my laptop that has a camera and was verified within 5 minutes. I had no problems with withdrawals after that.

**Capital gains suck.** I took all the risk of buying into crypto yet I am going to be on the hook for close to 30K to the government for my long term gains. There is no way I am fucking around with the IRS though, so I will happily pay them. I still have some other crypto and will most likely start buying back in again in a few months. In a few years when I retire I will most likely try to live off of 37.5K income per year from selling crypto so I do not have to pay those capital gains. After a few years of that I will dip into my traditional retirement accounts. I still need to find out if I need to pay an estimated tax payment this quarter to avoid a penalty for not having enough taken out of my paycheck to cover my taxes for the year.

My hat is off to those that are still hodling. It has already gone up quite a bit since I sold. I might look back at selling and kick myself in the future, but right now the thought of being debt free is pretty liberating. 
**It has been one fucking hell of a ride and I will be back on the coaster with the rest of you soon!**

The computer was overloaded with incoming data, because the rendezvous radar system (not necessary for landing) updated an involuntary counter in the computer, which stole cycles from the computer. Due to its robust architecture, the computer was able to keep running; the Apollo onboard flight software was developed using an asynchronous executive so that higher priority jobs (important for landing) could interrupt lower priority jobs. Initially, the fault had been attributed to a faulty checklist and the radar being erroneously activated by the crew, but a 2005 re-analysis concluded that a hardware design error in the rendezvous radar provided the computer with faulty information even while in standby mode.[9]

Due to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.""

I’m a sophomore majoring in computer science. I originally came to my university as an MIS major, but disliked the heavy business emphasis and wanted to learn coding more anyways, so this was my first semester in CS.

I’m currently in Computer Org and Intro to Computing. I’m barely passing Computer Org (I think he’s curving, however, I just really don’t understand anything in the class) and I have 97% A in Intro to Computing.

The thing is, I don’t feel like I’ve earned my A. I’ve needed help from the teachers assistant and my lab and lecture profs to attain that grade thus far. I somehow managed to get an A- on my midterm exam even though I couldn’t finish 2 of the 4-5 programs on the test because my mind went blank. 

Tonight, I was doing another assignment related to sorting a text file and decrypting it and such and I was only able to finish it because I asked my prof for help and he sent me some stuff he went over in virtual lecture more in depth. 

I just feel really stupid. The girl I work with all the time in lab seems to grasp it more quickly than me a lot and she’s not even majoring in CS. Sometimes I can work on a problem for days and nights and not figure it out. I really want to succeed and do this but I’m getting really worried. I was never a strong math student in HS and in college I’ve done acceptable but I’m not a wizard by any means.

I just find myself questioning a lot if I’m really doing the right thing. I have really severe depression and anxiety so every time I can’t solve something or mess up, I automatically assume I’m a dumbass and I should just crawl back to IT because that’s all I’ll ever be good for and I’m a joke for even thinking I could major in CS and learn a programming language.

I just guess I want to know if my feelings are valid, if I should really be worried like I am or if it’s just my poor mental state messing with my head, or what. When I get things right, they usually go great and I feel happy and like I’m successful. When they go bad, I rethink my entire life and major. I’m planning on taking Data Structures and Discrete Structures next sem and I’m honestly pretty freaked out because I’ve heard they’re hard - I have to take calc at some point to even graduate and I’m practically having anxiety just thinking about that. 

Sorry, I know this post was kinda long and ranty but I just got done with that assignment and needed to dump some stuff off my chest. I just don’t feel super smart like a lot of the people in my classes and I feel stupid that I need help a lot (sometimes, simple things that I barely messed up, like putting a print statement in the wrong place - sometimes I need better explanation and some starting points). I guess I just wanted to hear from some of the rest of you about your experiences with these feelings and how you overcame them or something like that. 

Thanks for reading my long winded post and taking the time to answer if you do :)",1587645417

We shouldn't have to feel a sense of unease in a place of learning, but I guess that's just the sad reality of our society. 

I've helped to make a petition with suggestions for how we can improve upon the security of parking areas in specific since these recent events have occurred in those areas. I haven't seen much of a surveillance system in the structures and that is alarming. My hope is that we'll be able to take this to the administration as a valid and unified suggestion. It may or may not work but I feel some action needs to be taken.

4700,CQHYO607QF3S1A5PJJJ2XSO7R,[deleted],Code is magic,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/du1vgf/code_is_magic/,"I just had a wonderful realization and I thought I might share. To preface this, I always wanted to go to Hogwarts as a kid and learn magic. I became somewhat disenfranchised with the world as I grew older, but I have recently begun to rekindle a sense of wonder and excitement for the world.

A big part of that has been learning to code. I was thinking about this the other day, and I realized that I have essentially been learning magic by any standard throughout history, and for some reason I take that for granted!

Through a high-level language, we manipulate electrons in order to create symbolic information patterns that can accomplish real tasks - to anyone from any other time in history, if they could see us they would think we were literally witches and wizards.

At Hogwarts the students learn to predict the rough future through magic. I can do the same with data analysis, game theory, and machine learning networks. They can see things from the other side of the world - I just finished coding a security cam for my dorm. They can imbue non-living matter with sentience - robotics. They can manipulate life - bioinformatics - if I had access to the right tools I could literally breed glowing animals. Artificial intelligence adds an even cooler aspect to this given we might soon be able to create sentience from non-sentient matter! Even the bad powers, killing people, controlling people etc are real - consumer programming, psychometric targeting through the internet, drone strikes, malicious hacking, etc.

By extension, everything we are exploring in modern science is really magic. We don't really know how this stuff works or why it works - if you look at the physical constants of the universe they seem somewhat arbitrary. While we do have a good sense of the relational properties between things in reality, we don't know why they are what they are - like electrons! We know the rules that dictate their interaction with other things in reality, but we don't know why they exist the way they do, where they came from, or for that matter where any of this really came from! Somehow through all these layers of abstraction, from basic properties of atoms and forces, to high-level symbolic computation, we manage to actually do stuff, and that stuff is no less absolutely amazing! I don't think it's hyperbole to say that we're all doing real magic.",1573363023

Networking

Pervasive Computing

Software Engineering

I have some knowledge in programming, like Java and Python languages (currently I work in company at junior position). But I want to learn CS to upgrade my programming skills, understand things, that hidden by levels of abstraction. So, I created a list with topics and books to read:

1. Intro to CS - Computer Science An Overview
2. Hardware - The Elements of Computer Systems (Nand2Tetris) / Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond
3. OS - Operating Systems Principles and Practice
4. Compilers - Engineering a Compiler
5. Sedgewick Algorithms
6. Computer Networking A Top Down Approach
7. Distributed systems (need advice)
8. ...

I just started my second year as a CS major but so far have mainly focused on math, science, and intro CS classes. I’m getting into the more serious classes now and finished my first week of C++ with almost no programming experience. I know it’s just one week, but small victories feel good too. 

I read every word of the assigned reading, viewed every slide, watched every lecture, and worked through almost every example from the book. (Recommendation to beginner’s: Read every word! Everything matters.) We started with 2 simple programs, which gave me some trouble, but I finally finished them earlier today. The experience was frustrating but very very satisfying. 

I’m feeling pretty good about my classes. Thanks to everyone who’s answered my previous CS questions. And special thanks to the user who helped me with discrete math. Have a good night everyone.

If you don't like the look of tkinter and instead want to use Qt, change the first line of code to

    import cv2, PySimpleGUIWeb as sg

[More Demo Programs](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/DemoPrograms) that show how to integrate OpenCV and other Python technologies with a GUI.

The 7 lines are a ""lump of code"". Not how it was written but rather an exercise of ""what happens when taking some code and trying to really compress it"".  Here's the ""real program""

pip install pysimplegui

pip install opencv-python

If you're on Linux / Mac, then use pip3 instead of pip.\]

Add \`Demo\_OpenCV\_Webcam\_ASCII.py\`  a   [Demo Program](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_OpenCV_Webcam_ASCII.py)  that shows your webcam, in realtime, as an ASCII movie.

Watch it run on YouTube -  [https://youtu.be/rzvJuz5bHTg](https://youtu.be/rzvJuz5bHTg)

I am taking a summer computer science class and the class is moving extremely fast. We go through like 3 chapters a class for a ten week class. I have a job and another summer class to worry about and can't always study. Recently, we were given a project and I am having a hard time trying to figure it out. I feel so stupid. I started early because I didn't understand the prompt. I asked all the kids in my class and they haven't even started. But seem not worrried. I asked my professor for certification and he could barely explain it to me simply. No one in my class seem worried about how fast we are moving because apparently they've already been over some of the topics. However, I'm a guest student at this university, at my home university we haven't been over these subjects. I just feel so stupid and discouraged. Apparently I'm on the right track for my homework. But I don't feel like I'll get everything right in time.

Python for Scientists and Engineers was the first book I wrote, and the one I still get queries about.  It had been out of print for more than a year, but I could never get myself to update it, because it looked like too much work.

Recently, I asked for help in updating it, and a few people volunteered. Thanks to these volunteers, the book is now free to read online (and will remain so). 

The book assumes you already know Python, or any other language. I feel there are too many resources for beginners, and not enough for intermediate/advanced programmers.

Anyway, check it out here:

I can't do the homework they assign me .I thought this maybe not that important but then i saw how important c++ is. I'm really worried.

Here's some helpful information about our school before school starts.

For those taking ENG101 or need help with writing business letters or writing, in general, we have a writing center on campus. Here's is the link to that.

[http://english.fullerton.edu/writing\_center/](http://english.fullerton.edu/writing_center/)

Appointments with the tutor

[https://fullerton.mywconline.com/](https://fullerton.mywconline.com/)

&#x200B;

For people wanting to work, the TSU and the library is the way to go. The second floor of the TSU has sofas and tables for you to work on hw and etc. In addition a quick tip if you have a large group study then I recommend you to rent out the study rooms at the Pollak Library. The link will be below this.

ID card not required at all times at the room

[https://titans.service-now.com/library/library\_catalog.do](https://titans.service-now.com/library/library_catalog.do)

2 ID cards required at the rooms all the time (Smart Rooms):

[https://apps.fullerton.edu/SGCReserve/](https://apps.fullerton.edu/SGCReserve/)

&#x200B;

For those people wanting a quiet place to study, the 3rd floor of the Pollak Library is the way to go.

&#x200B;

For those people needing help on creating their resumes, I would definitely check out the career center. That can be located on this room **LH 208.** They offer a wide range of services from checking your resumes to preparing an interview. You can definitely count on them with anything relating to internships/jobs.

&#x200B;

For those wanting a place to chill/hangout, I highly recommend TSU Underground. They have bowling, arcades and etc. A quick tip is that Bowling is free usually during Finals week so if you want to Bowl for free then you have that opportunity. In addition, some clubs will have events like free bowling, so definitely take advantage of that if you want to Bowl.

&#x200B;

For those wanting cheap foods around campus, well you have options like Baja Express, Ensenada's Surf N Turf Grill, In N Out, McDonald's, Pepe's, Curry Hut and other more.

&#x200B;

For those wanting free refills, look no further to Carl Jr. The refills cost $1.08 so take advantage of that!

&#x200B;

For those people in a hurry to eat look no further to Grubhub! If you install the app and select our school you should be able to order food ahead of time instead of waiting in line as the lines do get huge during lunch and dinner.

&#x200B;

For those wanting to park on the weekends, the parking lot is free. You can park anywhere for free.

&#x200B;

For those wanting the best coffee in the town look no further than Philz Coffee. It 7-8min walk from the Nutwood Parking Structure. 

&#x200B;

For those wanting the best chicken, there is Raising Cane's 6.1 miles from school.

&#x200B;

Another thing, that I want to mention before I end, is that the Library is open 24hrs the week prior to finals week. In addition, they will continue on until the last day of the Finals day. In addition, the TSU is opened 24 hours during the finals week.

Other than,

I wish you all a wonderful semester! Good luck in your classes! Go Titans!",1566794155
4865,DAGQ7HO3OIXX5RB3H5B4CR5W7,[deleted],A word of encouragement (my quick story to start CS),computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/60o72h/a_word_of_encouragement_my_quick_story_to_start_cs/,"I was going through my posts this morning while I was waiting for my morning coffee, and saw u/sleepy815 's post ""Feeling discouraged with C++"" and wanted to pass on a word of encouragement to the community, collectively, for those of you beginning your Journey or struggling to continue.

Firstly, I most definitely encourage your continuation of your pursuit of Computer Science. It's *hard*. In fact, as a Computer Scientist, you are a professional ""creative"" problem solver.
By the very nature of what we do, we must be agile in approaching each problem, as our field is continually changing and moving in many, many directions. It can be hard to keep up with it all, and incredibly daunting to even approach. 

Even once you've reached your stride, you may find it challenging to take it all in; so I wanted to share my story and its incredibly unlikely destination of CS. 

In High School, I wanted to be an artist. More specifically, I wanted to be a character designer for some video game / movie company. However, come time to apply for college, after a great deal of contemplation and discussion with my parents, I opted to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering (but I had a history of being rubbish at maths). I had a slight taste of programming with a class on Visual Basic (which hardly counts). 

Then, came college. Freshman year was *exhausting*. Never before had I experienced a real programming language; but in our introductory course we learned C++ and Python. In retrospect, these concepts aren't as challenging as I *perceived* it to be. This was an insurmountable obstruction. I struggled vehemently, and to make it worse, I had enrolled in the ""advanced"" section, wherein you were expected to have prior programming experience. I came in expecting visual basic and found, instead, the monster of C++.

I felt as though I was at the bottom of the pack, taking hours against my peers' alleged minutes to complete an assignment. 

*In fact*, come the end of my class, I had proudly proclaimed that:

##I am never taking a CS course again! 

I was so excited; CS was a huge challenge and I finally managed to endure to the class's end. Turns out, I hated Electrical Engineering, but I felt trapped, I had no other options. There was nothing I liked!

But, this couldn't have been further from the truth. I missed the challenge contained in each assignment and the triumph I felt upon finally submitting my *masterpiece*. 

So, I went back. 

This year, I am a Junior in College, though I am a Sophomore in the CS program, here. I have a solid 3.7 in my CS courses and I couldn't be happier with my decision to stick it through.

Point being, everyone starts somewhere different. Hell, I am a year behind! (My girlfriend, a Freshman, is already taking many of the courses directly prior to mine...which sucks, but I'm still making *progress*). In fact, I have failed every single Calculus class I have ever taken before passing it (not a C- or above). Discrete mathematics and onward were no problem, but it's not like I didn't struggle! 

As long as *you* are better at what you're doing today than when you were yesterday, that's all that matters. 

So, do your homework, struggle through your project, pursue your interests. It *will* pay off. You'll be happier for it; you'll experience that legendary satisfaction, and if you're devoted, you will out-mode your peers or colleagues. 

If a pleb like me can figure it out;
you, kind friend, most definitely can. ",1490138565

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

The following videos are a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Video 1: What Is Bitcoin & Why Should You Care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSQdhxnvCc)
* [Video 2: The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU&index=1&list=FLqnDHJBl3xGTosMjyXc4-0A)
* [Video 3: Bitcoin Is Independent Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzFOwFXlR48)
* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)

For some more great introductory videos check out [Andreas Antonopoulos's YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkxdys-Ek9U), he is probably the best bitcoin educator out there today.   Also have to give mention to James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&index=6&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q).  Lots of additional video resources can be found at the [videos wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/videos) or /r/BitcoinTV.  

**Key properties of bitcoin**

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving countdown can be found [here](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/).
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockexplorer.com/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee** - Transactions fees can vary between a few cents and a few dollars depending on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction. 
 Most wallets calculate the fee automatically but you can view current fees [here](https://bitcoinfees.21.co/).
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](http://bitcoinglobe.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Encrypted cryptographically and can’t be [brute forced](https://miguelmoreno.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds to a [few minutes](https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time) depending on need for confirmations.  After a few confirmations transactions are irreversible.  
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer).
* **Portable** - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can even be transported by simply [remembering a string of words](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) for wallet recovery.
* **Scalable** - Each bitcoin is [divisible down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability) allowing it to grow in value while still accommodating micro-transactions.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoins?

[BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) and [Howtobuybitcoin.io](https://howtobuybitcoin.io/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also, check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  

Bank Transfer | Credit / Debit card | Cash 
---|---|---
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) | [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) | [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
[Gemini](https://gemini.com/) | [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) | [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
[GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/) | [Bitit](https://www.bitit.gift/?referral=JTWWAIRY) | [Mycelium LocalTrader](http://mycelium.com/lt/help.html)
[Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) | [Cex.io](https://cex.io/cards/) | [BitQuick](https://www.bitquick.co/?a=98201) 
[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) | [CoinMama](https://www.coinmama.com/) | [WallofCoins](https://wallofcoins.com/en/?frame=1)
[Xapo](https://xapo.com/) | | [BitcoinOTC](https://bitcoin-otc.com/)
[Cex.io](https://cex.io/cards/) | 
[itBit](https://www.itbit.com/) |
[Bitit](https://www.bitit.gift/?referral=JTWWAIRY) |
[Bitsquare](https://bitsquare.io/) |  

[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Cashila](https://www.cashila.com/) or [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd/1hr) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. [Preev](http://preev.com/btc/usd) is a useful site that  that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google ""1 bitcoin in (your local currency)"".

## Securing your bitcoins

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoins for you.


* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, there are many software wallet options [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).  If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/) or [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) is recommended.  A more advanced option is to secure them yourself using [paper wallets](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) generated offline.  Some popular mobile and desktop options are listed below and most are cross platform.  

Android | iOs | Desktop
--------------------|-----|-----
[Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet)  | [BreadWallet](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breadwallet/id885251393) | [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home)
[CoPay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.copay&hl=en) | [AirBitz](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-wallet-map-directory/id843536046?mt=8) | [Armory](https://btcarmory.com/)

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Xapo](https://xapo.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  

Another interesting use case for physical storage/transfer is the [Opendime](https://opendime.com/).  Opendime is a small USB stick that allows you to spend Bitcoin by physically passing it along so it's anonymous and tangible like cash.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.  

Google Auth | Authy
--------------------|-----
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8)

A good resource for UK residents is at [wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk](http://www.wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk).

There are also lots of charities which accept bitcoin donations, such as [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give#bitcoin), [Red Cross](https://bitpay.com/520663/donate), [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/), [United Way](http://www.unitedway.org/content/splash_holiday2014/), [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) and the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/).

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3). [Bitseed](https://bitseed.org/) is an easy option for getting set up.  You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Earning bitcoins

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoins by being paid to do a job.

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)
microbitcoin | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (μL) or micrometre (μm)
bit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.02 BTC
* 20 mBTC
* 20,000 bits

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Just hit the halfway mark of my program. I have always had an interest in teaching CS, and I always thought it would be at the university level. Lately though, the idea of being a high school computer science teacher excites me. I’d love to introduce CS to teenagers and get them excited about it. I feel like too many people are intimidated by programming, and I would like to help bring confidence to students who have some interest. It would be cool to even teach some AP classes too and cover things like data structures. 

So my question is, what’s it like teaching CS in high school, and how can I make this a possibility for me?

By next summer, I will have graduated with a BS in Computer Science. I enjoy the field and it's something I feel like I can do a lot with, I'm definitely interested in it.

The problem I run into is that I feel so inexperienced. My older brother studied com sci for seven years (retaking courses that he didn't do well) and he did a few projects over the years, but he couldn't find any work for a while and even now, he's under paid and at a job where, as he describes, he doesn't do a whole lot of coding. What I'm trying to get at is, I don't want to land a job like this. I'd like to shoot big and go for something like Google, but I'm fairly confident that that is currently out of my realm of possibility at the moment. 

I haven't done any real personal projects, nor have I interned anywhere (these are the two biggest things I hear that com sci majors need to do) so I fear that I will appear undesirable to any potential employers. I make great grades in my courses (received my AS with above a 3.5 gpa, currently have a 3.4 as I transferred to a university last year) but don't think this will be enough. 

My questions here and basically a Tl;Dr:
How can I, as a senior in college with no experience in the field, become more desirable to future potential employers? 

What sorts of projects away from school projects do employers like to see? I've coded a few algorithms in regards to graph theory using python, though c++ is my native language.

What are some must-know things every com sci person should know before going into an interview?

What have you done in the past to ""set yourself apart"" from the competition?

These are just questions to get the ball rolling, feel free to add or just answer whatever you want.

Thanks.",1530947019

AMA!,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iuqwk/3rd_best_day_of_my_life_ama/,"I was sifting through my things in storage. I used to be self employed doing IT consulting. I found my old computer. I thought I might have part of a bitcoin or two on there as I’ve been an avid bitcoin evangelist. So opened up a command prompt and in C:\ typed “dir wallet.dat /a/s” and I found one.  So I looked and apparently I had run the windows GUI for bitcoind on this machine at one point.

I opened up the bitcoin GUI and the balance stated: 55. I was confused for a second and asked myself “55? Why does it say 55?”  I looked at the transaction log and I saw two things: an entry for having signed a block and a payment of 5 extra BTC.

I live down the street from my parents and I shot up, ran out the door down to my parents house “Dad! Dad! We gotta go, I need you to come to my house right now, don’t worry about shoes!”  Being a once in a life time event I felt he could run to my house barefoot and see this with me ... dick move I know!  He was excited, he’s one of those guys that got on the hype train at 5500 and threw a couple hundred bucks in lol!

So I grabbed the wallet.dat, threw it up on my “vault” server I run, and waited for it to convert and scan the whole blockchain again. An hour later ... I am surprised I have my fingernails left... I typed “bitcoin getbalance” on my box and sure enough.. “55.00000000”. Pretty sure my right hand still hurts from the high five I gave my dad!  I also play Eve Online, and I might have been laughing my ass off and having a great time with my alliance as well ... god I’m a nerd! Went over to my best friend’s house, told her as she has had to suffer through endless bitcoin is great rants, she was like “stfu! No you didn’t! Omfg!”

In the summer of 2010 I was able to sign a block using a Core I7-920, and since it was worth (roughly) 7 cents a bitcoin then, I determined my computer power was better spent doing other stuff and/or not mining. A bit after that I upgraded my 3 drive raid 0 to an SSD and didn’t migrate everything. A couple years back I found a couple wallet.dat files on that SSD but didn’t check the raid array until Friday.

I called my cousin who is a CPA/lawyer, and I told her that I had felt like I had won the lottery and she said to me “every time I hear about bitcoin I think of you, you didn’t win the lottery, you were Into it before the hype, you knew what it was when other people thought it was and still think it is weird. The real thing is you’re lucky because you forgot about it!”  This week, I’m going to pay off my house/car/credit cards, put at least 150k into a college fund for my two boys, start looking into paying my taxes and you know pinching myself to make sure I’m not dreaming!

While I should HODL... I have cashed out most of them ... I feel like not having a mortgage payment was a huge plus. And by the way, Bitcoin Cash and the other forks... bless your hearts!  The day my two boys were born were the two best days of my life!  Merry-f’ing-Christmas!

I bought it because I thought in a sense I was donating to a cause, not for an investment. It went to $950. At one point my $4000 was worth half a million, which was almost 10× my portfolio. I sold 5 Bitcoin and spent a bit for some weed on the silk road (I was 20, please forgive me. Besides, back then, other than an eBay type website that you could buy gift cards from, you couldnt get much with bitcoin. Anybody remember the famous pizza?) Than bitcoin tumbled to $300. I invested in Doge with some of it, lost a lot there. I had over 5mil doge coin lost in a reddit tip wallet. I took my family on vacation through expedia after i had each of my kids, now 3. And once with my mom, so she could take the grand kids to disney world (she always wanted to take me and my sisters but single parent life sucks) After all the investments I should not have made, and the fun I do not regret having, I am a proud owner of 1.5 BTC.
The reason I made this post is so people can see the ups and downs of Bitcoin. Please understand, everything is about price now, but at one point it wasn't. It was the dread pirate Roberts sticking it to the man, it was people using bitcoin as a way to protest our government bailing out banks and letting us middle class and lower suffer. Trust me when I say a 50% change in bitcoin is not strange. I personally hope it shakes the greedy people off and liberates us like it was designed to do. A world wide currency, untouchable by our greedy governments. If I want to send money to a young man in Taiwan because I believe in his invention, I should be able to. Just as I once sent money to a magic card trading website in exchange for magic internet money because I believed in the cause.

Edit: fat fingers, cell phone post.

To my unfortunate surprise, that technically puts me on the list that Coinbase was ordered to handover to the IRS. I do not blame Coinbase and am satisfied that they fought against the action. 

However, since I believe that this is *highly* overstepping taxpayers rights as well as conflicts of parity: i.e. does the IRS get notified if I invest 20k in mutual funds? I intend to document any and all interactions I have with any government body here for this community to review.

I want all of us to be vocal, transparent, and prepared to protect our assets under due process. 

I have dutifully paid U.S. taxes since day one of my working life. I have **not profited** one cent as of yet with any cryptocurrency, since I have not sold one Satoshi of my holdings. I plan to arm myself with the most practical legal advice available to me and, if it comes to it, support from bitcoin-friendly financial advisors that know their stuff.

Thanks for listening. HODL on.

*EDIT: Looks like I got the tax year(s) wrong; thanks for setting me straight. Keeping this post up as my sentiment about this action remains unchanged.* 

*EDIT 2: Holy crypto Batman! I am FINE paying taxes on my gains. I am NOT looking for, nor am I advocating tax evasion. The point of this post is simply that I plan to report and document any IRS scrutiny should it occur.*",1512311166

It looks [like this](https://i.imgur.com/LQi8ccg.png).
It's cross platform and requires only minimal changes to your code (if you're already using the logging module). 

It can do most things you would expect: searching, filtering, multiple connections, customization of the output table, limiting number of records per connection, merging records of several tabs. There's also a [dark theme](https://i.imgur.com/BGUqHM2.png)!

It can also do things you would _not_ expect, because it's in beta and may have bugs. Submit an issue on GitHub if you find one of those!

This is my first released project of any kind, so any feedback is welcome.",1515718432

We’re a team of three university friends who decided it would be cool to make our lives easier by being able to find and evaluate research papers faster than it currently is. So we built a small browser extension which supports Chrome (Firefox coming soon!) and works on top of Google Scholar. 

Among many other approaches, we’re using Deep Learning, topic modelling and lots of techniques from Natural Language Processing to get insights about what – and, more importantly, how – people talk about the papers. We’re still in an early beta stage, adding more papers and useful functionality every day (we’re currently working on search results personalization).

I solve a lot of problems and I use a lot of great libraries, but have no hope of understanding their implementation because my skills in Python plateaued long ago.

It would be nice to get a small daily/weekly dose of advanced topics in Python:

* what is ""ABCmeta""
* how to implement a decorator with arguments
* what under-under attributes exist in an object
* [protocols](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5yxz8d/i_want_to_learn_advanced_python/detryp7/) - what the heck is that?
* metaclasses
* [How to write better code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go) - this [example](https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go?t=823) of using `iter` is quite succinct.
* [Libraries that change the semantics of Python OOP](https://pypi.org/project/PEAK-Rules/)
* What are [descriptors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9pxgo9/check_out_my_github_repo_with_presentations_on/)

Also, news have been circulating that China is pumping billions into its home grown Linux distros with literally thousands of people working on it. China are hesitant upon using propriarity instruction sets like x86, by reason of national security and the tension between China and the US.

5171,DJWU9MF04EOPBMEKNQO3AXYFR,PureCamel,"Just finished a Bachelor's in CS, where do I go from here?",computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8hruh0/just_finished_a_bachelors_in_cs_where_do_i_go/,"Hey there everyone, first reddit post... I'm writing because I'm honestly burnt out trying to figure out what to do next. I'm sorry if this becomes a rant \(it will\) but I just need to vent out my whole situation, this is also going to be therapeutic for me... my questions will be in **bold.**

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from some obscure university in the Middle East in December. I'm not sure how much I've gained from this degree, it doesn't feel like much given what's happened so far but I know I enjoy developing and I've definitely learnt useful skills which will always be beneficial to me. This degree wasn't all that mathematical and didn't really dive into core computer science principles at depth but instead focused on touching on all these principles and proceeding to take the next semester's fees.

I've even done some side projects to learn what it's like developing practically and that's been more than positive, I've even published a visually appealing but not too technical app on the Play Store. I've interned at a collaborative maker space where I used to give workshops on hardware like Arduino and RPi, it wasn't entirely technical since these workshops were pretty basic but still, it helped with working on computer hardware, my public speaking skills, and meeting some interesting people. 

\*I should mention that my overall grades aren't too great in the CS subjects on my transcripts, I've struggled personally for no good reason throughout my undergrad and it's reflected on my grades in the more technical subjects and it does affect my confidence in this field at times because I can start measuring myself by those grades

I moved to Canada soon after I finished university since I'm a resident; I want to continue studying and start a career in software engineering over here but it's been rough so far. I applied for a Master's in Computer Science at several universities in Ontario \(Carleton, Ryerson, Waterloo, Western and some more...\). I've been rejected by all the ones in parentheses. I applied for a coursework Master's \(where they're available\) because I have no idea what research to work on, I felt as if I was lacking the skills for a thesis and thought doing a coursework degree would help me settle in the country and hopefully help me find what I wanted to work on in the future. I also applied for part\-time status as I felt I could try and work at the same time, my thinking is that all this status and degree type stuff can change later on if it's necessary, I should just focus on sending an application and get into a school. I visited Waterloo to see the campus and talk to the graduate office for Computer Science as well, which imo was a positive experience. \(**Did I go about this right? I researched all the programs for a long time but it felt overwhelming because besides knowing I want to work on AI, I didn't know much more\)**

Carleton was the first to reject me, and then Ryerson, after this happened I really felt as if getting an acceptance from the rest, namely Waterloo & McMaster, was far\-fetched because they're all better than these two. Sure enough, that's what happened. I contacted someone at every university after I received my rejection emails to ask for the exact reason my application was declined, and also to provide me with a way forward. Ryerson was the only university that really provided me with sufficient feedback, saying my GPA was too low, and advised I could try enrolling into a Bachelor's in Canada and shave the relevant credits off with my previous degree. That felt ridiculous, that I'd have to dig up my high school transcripts \(not great reading, btw\) and apply ALL OVER again for an undergraduate degree, when people are getting their offer letters. Additionally, I didn't do math in high school so I knew that'd be a roadblock, I'll come back to this.

Ryerson at least talked to me, I even visited the campus and Chang School of Continuing Education to talk to their advisors about what to do next. Waterloo sent a *manually typed automated message* about how competitive the process is and how many factors are taken into account for the application, I don't even know how to respond to this email \(open to suggestions\). Carleton, meh, not a great experience. Western didn't even respond back. 

I expected this whole process to be tough especially with my university transcript, and I was and am ready to do any extra work to gain admission but the fact that the universities have been so unhelpful in talking to me is very disheartening. I feel like I'm doing something wrong in the way I'm approaching this, maybe I should just move my ass and go to the campus and talk to them physically. \(**Can I open a dialogue up with the universities through e\-mail and set up a meeting with them in person and trying to ask them when I'm there, it just feels very pointless given all that's happened thus far.\)**

I tend to get anxious which I can work through, but once I'm there I just hear the same stuff that I've seen online which ends with saying that the whole application process is online and that I can't get personal advice pertaining to my situation besides any extra questions I might have about the programs. Additionally, the admin faculty isn't that open to giving personal advice until you're actually a student, something mentioned explicitly on some universities' sites. 

So, I'm coming off some serious depression because of all this and some other personal stuff but I've started feeling better and I'm finally thinking clearly again, ready to start the grind once more. Working off of Ryerson's advice, I'm open to redoing a Bachelor's in CS. I know this might seem like a step back, but I also know that settling in Canada is really tough after talking to friends and family, perhaps in the long run this won't seem as major as it does now. 

I'm even willing to go back to do the required high school courses as well because I could finish them off this summer, plus applying through a school is MUCH easier since I'll get a Canadian HS diploma with my old school grades \(British\) converted in the process, and I could talk to an academic counselor which I feel I desperately need. Also, I'm thinking if I'm going to do an undergrad degree again, I might as well fancy it up by double majoring with Neuroscience because this is something that I'm deeply interested in, even my computer science interests lie in AI so I know that a combination of these two fields could prove valuable in the future. **What does anyone who's made it this far \(thank you, btw\) think about this idea?** My school background is mainly in the sciences in any case.

That's the education part of it, I've also been trying to get a job or an internship in Canada but that hasn't proved very fruitful. I've signed up on job sites, LinkedIn, and a local service called Career Edge that helps new grads and newcomers to Canada get paid internships to gain experience in the country and land a job in the future with that experience and networking. Career Edge has really been the only helpful service, they helped me build my profile while I was overseas and the one internship I applied for was with them; the interview went really well but in terms of skills they wanted someone who knew C# and I've been raised on C\+\+ and Java so I didn't know the proper syntax and intricacies of it, plus the logic question threw me off \(swap an int without a temp variable\). They got back saying that they needed someone who knew C# because there was no time to train someone from scratch. Besides this, I don't know how else to go at it with a foreign degree and that's why I'm focused more on the education, I'll get a Canadian degree, I'll gain some much\-needed knowledge, and going to a university will naturally open up opportunities in the job market. 

**Should I try finding a job instead of the whole academic pursuit I'm planning on doing? I feel as if doing a job will be good in the short term but to progress further I'll have to study more later on so I might as well set myself up now. Plus, having done a Bachelor's already I'll be much cooler about it now by being open to all the opportunities like taking time off to work if needed.**

Thanks to anyone whose read this and I'll appreciate all the responses! :D

I'd add a tl;dr but I'm gonna be lazy because I've spent a while typing all this out plus it all ties in.

While I have enjoyed working with python, and have learned a lot about CS, my interest has grown dramatically. The problem for me is that I find myself missing foundational aspects of CS which make it difficult to read explanations in stackoverflow, or documentation on particular libraries.

I am now hoping to pick up another language that may be a little more explicit in its implementation so that I can try to understand what I am doing most of time with python. My only complaint thus far has been that python feels incredibly implicit in how it operates (this could be solely due to my own ignorance)

It is called Spacetime Engine.

[github.com/spacetimeengineer/spacetimeengine](https://github.com/spacetimeengineer/spacetimeengine)

My name is Michael. I am a physicist who works as an engineer.  My story is that in October 2018 I was preparing to submit my first physics publication, which reviewed a particular cosmological model that I had been working with for some time. I was at the point where I had completed all of my research and was fully prepared. The only problem was that at the time I felt concerned that I may have made some mistakes which went unnoticed, so I decided to write a computer algebra software to check the veracity of my solutions so that I could feel confident in my results. After using this new utility, I realized I had made some fairly significant errors in my approach, and so the software apparently did it’s job. At first I was quite frustrated because I had put  a significant amount of time into this solution, but I realized I had a new ability to correct my own errors and expand upon what I already knew. I was now able to study any solution, and not just the ones that interested me. In fact, anyone could study any solution to the Einstein field equations if they wanted to by using this software. For this reason I realized the research I wanted to publish was not yet ready to be submitted, but the software became the real publication. I then decided to polish, package, and publish the code into a form that was accessible, informative, and educational. If you are a student new to general relativity, a gravity researcher actively working with solutions to the Einstein field equations, or an engineer who is interested in importing some of the functionality, then this package should come in handy. I was not able to publish my physics research, unfortunately, but I felt that this project served as a good alternative, and perhaps had more potential value. If you have technical questions, use the Github tools to communicate with me. You can install the package with

&#x200B;

$ pip install spacetimeengine

&#x200B;

I want to thank the r/Python community for maintaining a platform for people like me to share my work. Enjoy!",1551646749

About two weeks ago, there was a substitute in for my Calculus teacher. He began talking to me about college and what I wanted to study. I said I was very interested in CS and programming. 

He says to me, “CS is a very difficult major. I don’t know many females who make it through all four years.”

I was dumbfounded. I did not say another word, but I wish I would have. How could you say that to an aspiring student? I would love to have another chance to chew this guy out. 

I knew I wanted to be a CS major since freshman year, and I’m not going to let some misogynistic loser tell me that I don’t have a good chance succeeding in my dream because of my gender. 


For some more context, this guy graduated with a mechanical engineering degree. I don’t know how he has any room to talk about the difficulty of CS.


Edit: For those of you who think I made this story up: what would I possibly gain out of that? I had an encounter with an asshole and wanted to share it because I know it (sadly) is a common problem in the CS community.",1551071751

Introducing Sanic, for when you gotta go fast!",Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/57i301/what_if_flask_was_async_and_6x_faster_out_of_the/,"After seeing how it was possible to [make python networking great again](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4hqd1b/uvloop_make_python_networking_great_again/), I was inspired to make a Flask-like microframework + web server that could take advantage of async IO and the work that the wonderful people are [magicstack](https://magic.io/blog/)  have been doing.

It's called Sanic, and it goes fast.  

### Sanic is:

* Async - handle requests asynchronously, just throw async before def
* Shiny - Runs on python 3.5
* Simple - Flask-like routing
* Lightweight - No special tools, just run it with python

## Benchmarks

| Server  | Implementation      | Requests/sec | Avg Latency |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------:| -----------:|
| Sanic   | Python 3.5 + uvloop |       30,601 |      3.23ms |

| Aiohttp | Python 3.5 + uvloop |        2,979 |     33.42ms |


## Syntax

    from sanic import Sanic
    from sanic.response import json
    
    app = Sanic(__name__)
    
    @app.route(""/"")
    async def test(request):
         return json({ ""hello"": ""world"" })
    
    app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=8000)

* [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) (drop-in replacement for python's event loop)

## Sup Reddit

This is my first open-source project and I'm looking for feedback and contribution if anyone is interested :)

Sanic was created because I love the freedom of Flask, but dislike deploying it and its lack of native async support.  I'm wondering if anyone else has the same feels, and/or is interested in using Sanic for their project. Your feedback is welcome!",1476500565

about a year ago my boss asked if there's any way we could monitor some machines we have up on racks in our DR site, i raised my hand and said i could write a python script that pings them and generates reports... he said 'awesome' do it... trouble was i had only a fleeting idea of what python is and no clue how to actually implement this...

i got home and started researching, took a couple of days to even start scripting anything but about a week later i had something that works... running this script is now one of my daily tasks

i then started tinkering with it sneakily during downtime even though i was technically never given permission to do it and eventually came up with a way to scrape user data from the network 24/7, i made it a point that this would be my own doing so research was limited to how to implement specific tasks and not downloading a ready made script off of github...

i've been logging this data for a while so i figured i should do something with it and started working on a support facing tkinter front end to streamline the way we handle support calls and tickets...

i showed it to my boss and he had me do a demo for the whole team today doing our team meeting... told everyone 'i encourage you to try it so we can get the bugs out, i'm later going to *tell* you to use it'... he said i'd also get dev time to improve it... everyone liked it and i've been getting good feedback about it... the feeling is amazing and i thought i'd share it with this community and maybe get some of your stories

EDIT: holy crap gold, and not for saying something silly, thank you kind stranger

EDIT 2: this kind of grew, i really want to thank everyone for the kind words of encouragement, i really only posted because i felt really excited pacing around the house after that meeting and felt i had to vent it all somehow, but this subreddit's response has been phoenomenal and has done a lot to further embolden me so i'm even more determined to progress now... thank all of you",1502325029
5280,DFA5ZO0VM95SOJ5N1BW2C9K7R,dragan15,Should I attend a programming Bootcamp if I'm already pursuing a degree in computer science?,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/ab2wok/should_i_attend_a_programming_bootcamp_if_im/,"starting this January, I'll be finishing up the final semester at a university, where I'll obtain a B.S in Computer Science. Today I received an email stating that I just got accepted to a 12-week long IOS Mobile Development Bootcamp that will begin in February. The Bootcamp itself is free as the company receives sponsors from other tech companies, so there will be no financial cost to me at all for attending this bootcamp. I'm not denying the practical experience that I'll obtain from the bootcamp, but I was wondering if my time could be better allocated elsewhere (like preparing for job interviews/applying for jobs). 

To give some background on my position, on top of completing my final 12 units that I need in order to graduate, this bootcamp will likely eat away the majority of the free time that I'll have left during the spring semester, and at the moment I do not have a job lined up for me after I graduate. During my current  winter break I've been allocating my daily free time towards applying to other places, organizing meetings for the school club that I'm running, and completing a few personal projects. I've also been working as a Software Engineering intern for a small startup, that will **not** likely lead to a full-time position. I also have limited experiences in mobile development as most of my personal projects and practical experiences are focused on the full-stack development of web-based software applications. I did make a few small apps, and I had a blast workin on those projects, so I wouldn't mind progressing my skills in mobile development. I just wouldn't know how applicable swift would be in the job market, along with mobile-development in general. I am taking a mobile development course as one of my final required courses at my university, where the emphasis would be on cross-platform apps, through c#, so this experience may make me more well-rounded?

  I'm at a position where I feel that I need to just focus on applying and preparing for interviews, and highlight the experiences that I had already completed. At the same time, this bootcamp may expose me to networking opportunities, amazing lectures, and cool projects that I can add onto my resume. Should I take the opportunity considering its free, or should I focus on job hunting until I land a position?

I am very new to Python, but I decided to have a go writing a script to do automate it.

You can't actually spell out every word with just the chemical names of elements but it gets reasonably close. 

Anyway, I decided to give my program the entire Bee Movie transcript and see what it could do. To say the least my science teacher was very confused when she pasted my email into word and it took up 69 pages.

Specialists value its universality for all types of the tasks. Today, one of the most important qualities is convenience of command execution, but often developers have to write a relatively simple program, the quality criterion of which is an intuitive graphical interface. You have several ways to do this by means of Python. The following development tools are among the most popular:

* [PyQt](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/). The widespread Qt library, which implementations are available in various languages. It’s written in C++ and is cross-platform. This library allows the development of applications that have familiar and ordinary appearance in the general sense of this word.
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)**.** This tool is often referred to as standard for developing GUI applications in Python, appeared back in the early 90s of the twentieth century. Due to the long history and ease of use, Tkinter has a rather extensive and active community. It’s thanks to it you can find a large number of semi-finished products or publications in the network and get an answer to any question at specialized forums.
* [WxPython](https://wxpython.org)**.** Another descendant of C++, namely WxPython, links the wxWidgets cross-platform library with Python. In some ways, Tkinter and WxPython are quite similar, but WxPython is slightly younger and is more advanced approach to creating GUI applications in Python. Also, the entry barriers for the start are quite low due to the rapidly developing and friendly community. Perhaps the installation and the first steps will require a little more effort than the tools described above, but believe me, the result is worth it!

At a certain stage I chose PyQt for my work and in this article would like to show you an example of creating the simplest application for a content manager; so you’ll get to know the GUI for Python, libraries for natural language processing, and several ways of creating \*.exe file from \*.py for Python 3.6 script.

# Step 1. Python GUI: Creating simple application with PyQt and Qt Designer

First you need to understand what software is wanted. The content manager of [Casino Now](https://casino-now.co.uk) project gives priority to such parameters of content as

* Word count
* Number of characters
* Percentage of stop words
* Keyword density
* Presence of keywords in headers
* List of popular n-grams
* Text’s uniqueness

If for some reason you haven’t yet installed the PyQt library, the simplest method is to enter this code in the command line

    pip3 install PyQt5

All support tools will be installed automatically. When the installation is completed, open Qt Designer and create the necessary form using standard elements.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1 – General view of the dialog box](https://preview.redd.it/ch0j426wgxe21.jpg?width=1138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd0047e99d031a95d1632d9e7476c7836dd69e04)

The following is the layout of future application. Don’t judge too harshly, this is just an introductory demo to show several possibilities ;)

&#x200B;

[Figure 2 – Dialog box](https://preview.redd.it/i1e9saywgxe21.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9236d074fa9b40151e6343d5dce1174468984e86)

Bear in mind the specialized tools to keep the graphical interface user-friendly regardless of workspace’ scaling.

&#x200B;

[Figure 3 – Example of saving workspace proportions when scaling](https://preview.redd.it/jeez8qxxgxe21.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1d0b6f128132a2185c83ad78e89d988b448f3f6)

In order to turn the interface into a program code for use, you have to save the resulting layout. Thus, the file with MainForm.ui extension is received. To get access in the framework from the project, you need to convert the MainForm.ui file to the \*.py extension. To do this, go through the command line to the folder containing the file with \*.ui and run the following command

    pyuic5 -x MainForm.ui -o MainForm.py

&#x200B;

[Figure 4 – File conversion](https://preview.redd.it/az5emddzgxe21.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=256f04d8bd8b32b7f697e9f9cf61260eeec995bf)

Thus, you get the file of required extension and can run a prototype of the application.

&#x200B;

[Figure 5 – Plug-ins of the developed application](https://preview.redd.it/35qvip40hxe21.jpg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdcd1fa72dc01dd2bc79dc2af6d298a9859c341a)

The full source code has the structure presented at Figure 6. You can find the expanded version on my Github [https://github.com/TinaWard](https://github.com/TinaWard). In this article, I’d like to explain the application’s build in more detail.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6 – Application code](https://preview.redd.it/qqkq0331hxe21.jpg?width=889&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee7b345c93410ffe5fb7fec4a6145874427e788b)

# Step 2. How to convert python script in exe

The most popular tools for building an application today are [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org) or [cx\_Freeze](https://anthony-tuininga.github.io/cx_Freeze/). For this article let’s focus on such building method as cx\_Freeze. As a matter of fact, it’s analogous to PyInstaller with the only difference that in case of PyInstaller you don’t need to write your own installer script (setup.py), but at the same time, the similar manipulations must be performed via the command line or in the \* .spec file. The tool cx\_Freeze is set in the standard way:

    pip install cx_freeze
    pip install –user cx_freeze

The first step in creating a full-fledged application is the proper formation of the setup.by file.

The following is the frame of this file. The steps of the **setup.by** file are intuitive, but let’s look in more detail. First of all, import two entities: the setup function and Executable class. The most informative is the **options** dictionary (dictionary of dictionaries as it's usually called), which is used to improve the build. It may have such parameters:

* **excludes** – list with description of modules not to be included in the assembly. You shouldn’t overuse this parameter, since you can overdo and delete what you really need: nested dependencies.
* **includes** – parameter opposite to excludes, that’s the list of signal modules that must be included in the assembly. Also cx\_freeze may not find some packages or modules, in particular if they were imported into similar package using the import function. If you have a GUI application, you have to specify the name of the script with the \*.py extension, in our case it’s **MainForm**.py.
* **packages** – compulsory packages to be included.
* **zip\_include\_packages** – list of packages to be archived
* **include\_files** – list of lines or files tuples that need to be added to the assembly, but these are not Python files.

Now let's take a closer look at the Executable class:

* **targetName** allows you to specify the name of the \*.exe file, by default it matches the name of the launching script.
* **base** = **‘Win32GUI’** If you set a parameter as described in the example, it means that the graphical application is processing and the console window will not appear.
* **icon** – parameter to set the icon of the application launcher, by default uses pictures with \*.ico ext.

&#x200B;

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    
    from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable
    import os
    options = {
    'build.exe': { 'icludes': ['MainForm'], 'packages': ['pandas'], 'excludes ': excludes } }
    os.environ['TCL_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\tcl\tcl8.6'
    os.environ['TK_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\tcl\tk8.6'
    setup(
    name = ""TextTool"", version = ""0.0"", description = ""Here write smth"", options = options, executables = [Executable('TextToolS.py', targetName = ‘ThisIsName.exe’)])

To compile you need to run the setup.py file. To do this, enter the following code via the command line from the project directory:

    python setup.py build

After that you will see the launch of the project build.

&#x200B;

[Figure 7 – Running project build](https://preview.redd.it/jgtrlj6khxe21.jpg?width=655&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480540ce993a8208c81fce78d18c3413149f8f9b)

Building a project can take from 10 seconds to several minutes, depending on the size and number of interconnected modules in your application.

Not always the project build runs smoothly, let’s look at some of the most common mistakes. Most of them can be solved by searching and writing in the correct parameters of the setup function in the setup.py file, but often due to laziness or lack of time, the temporary ways are implemented to solve this problem. For example, this one, when you haven’t specified the module’s addition:

&#x200B;

[Figure 8 – Error example](https://preview.redd.it/dx9fl0glhxe21.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3955eff4159f0fdff1a670fe7d664e05f11a5cce)

    ""Missing required dependencies {0}"".format(missing_dependencies))
    ImportError: Missing required dependencies ['numpy']

To make this just copy \_methods.py file from Anaconda library

…\\Anaconda3\\Lib\\site-packages\\numpy\\core

to numpy folder ‘core’, located

…\\build\\exe.win-amd64-3.6\\lib\\numpy\\core.

&#x200B;

[Figure 9 – First type error fix](https://preview.redd.it/jd0b7ufnhxe21.jpg?width=794&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f7e9f296b4f18d85b7466810e16af8af6527de6)

The second common mistake is undersampling hidden dependencies. It’s possible that you didn’t see the hidden dependencies of the packages and didn’t add it. Often the problem occurs with packages like idnadata

&#x200B;

[Figure 10 – Second type error](https://preview.redd.it/46jgu19ohxe21.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e60341d7b67b77cad604b95cbcfb313ddc1edd69)

    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\tldextract\__init__.py"", line 3, in <module>
    from .cli import __version__
    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\tldextract\cli.py"", line 14, in <module>
    from .tldextract import TLDExtract
    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\tldextract\tldextract.py"", line 62, in <module>
    import idna
    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\idna\__init__.py"", line 2, in <module>
    from .core import *
    File ""C:\Users\User3\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\idna\core.py"", line 1, in <module>
    from . import idnadata
    ImportError: cannot import name 'idnadata'

The algorithm is the same, you find the missing file in the folders of the installed libraries and copy it in the appropriate folder of your assembly. This’s win-win option if you need a quick compilation for testing.

From …\\Anaconda3\\Lib\\site-packages\\idna to …\\build\\exe.win-amd64-3.6\\lib\\idna

&#x200B;

[Figure 11 –Second type error fix](https://preview.redd.it/exn2z8tphxe21.jpg?width=692&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2963ac8ae8552f8295d824068ad19c9d7578c062)

In general, the advantages of cx\_Freeze are:

* Startup files for Linux
* MSI installers for Windows
* RPM packages for Linux
* Software packages for Mac OS X (.app, .dmg)

The disadvantages are:

* No possibility to pack all python-modules and dll-files in one exe-file
* No cross compilation

# Conclusion

In this article we have looked at the principles of creating a GUI application in Python using PyQt and compiling the created app to \*.exe by means of cx\_Freeze. I hope you enjoyed this article, if you have any questions, please contact [tina.ward@mail.uk](mailto:tina.ward@mail.uk).",1549479190

I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.

I and my immediate family were frightened due to obvious safety concerns, angered by our privacy being invaded and highly concerned over a gentle man trying, trying to recover from his life threatening health concerns. He was so private that he did not tell me when he was going through his health threats, only told me quietly when I visited the house in Temple City to take our mother for lunch. And I am his blood brother.

I recall as a child that I looked up to Dorian, who I believe is many times smarter than I am. He taught me as a toddler, protected me from harm, shared with me Manga, the Japanese comic books and made up fantastic stories til I fell asleep. I am forever indebted to him in saving my life when I was 9 years old. He probably doesn’t remember anymore, but I do and that’s what matters to me.  I called the writer an asshole and told her to leave my brother alone but the whole world did not read that, why?  Dorian can be stubborn and be an asshole but then I am telling the whole world right here and now that I and only 2 other people in the whole world can say that to him and we are automatically forgiven by him in an instant. He can call me an asshole too and has and maybe a few “idiot” or “morons”, but you know, he was probably right and can prove it. That’s private. 

 How dare this Leah demean, belittle the comforts of an old man in poor health who has barely enough money to feed himself and takes gentle care of our 93 year old mother in a modest house. To act and publish with carefully studied thought along with professional profilers, editors who calculated greed to ultimately endanger my brother's health and his physical safety. To be callous enough to place the safety of our 93 year old mother as a person of no consequence? Their collective act that published their magazines and follow-up public reports speak volumes of the motivation tied to greed. Who is going to be responsible in their safety, her, the executives at Newsweek, the entire Journalistic community? Yes, I place Leah McGraw Goodman and Newsweek and all news organizations that had joined in the feeding frenzy to be held responsible for their blatant and open carelessness.

I understand that I will be mis-quoted in this post and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. I can and will have no choice that to be slandered and live with that.  What I want to make clear is that I am pleading, no, begging for all to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. Funny thing is that growing up we were always hungry because there was never enough and lunch was our largest meal. What do I have to do? Show everyone my bowl legs due to malnutrition? His legs which are worse? What lower level of indecency is required to quench their thirst for what I cannot fathom? 

Do you know what's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is?   I cannot physically go to see him and my mother. To come together as a family to support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger.  I can’t go over there to bring groceries or have a private discussion.

Edit: 
I have found a picture of me and my brother. I hope this evidence is more concrete.

In China, Bachelor scholar students learn the fundamental courses such as: C/C++ language, Java, C#, computer architecture, data structure, computer network, operating system, compiler, database and so on. Most of us don't have any pre-knowledge before we start college as we have to prepare for the national college entrance exam which is the same as SAT in USA (some students in Peking University and Tsinghua  University may already acquire the ability of coding in ACM competition though). Except from courses, we mostly do some competitions or researches with teammates and teachers to improve our ability.

So my question is, in terms of learning the algorithms commonly used to sort data structures, which book does a better job at providing good explanations along with thoughtful exercises? 

I am also conscious that this could just be a waste of time/inefficient and I might be better of working through HackerRank questions instead and ensure I fully understand the solutions to questions I am unable to complete, so any advise on what you believe would be best to do over the remaining 2/3 weeks of my break would also be really appreciated! :)",1577568492

&#x200B;

When I took  a class using C, I learned that an array is essentially one long chain of memory allocated for however long the array is.   Lets say you defined a variable n as an array of 100 ints, and you wanted to get the value of whatever int is located at index 10.

int a = n\[10\];

So, in order for the computer to find index 10, does it not crawl up the chain until it finds 10?  Or does the computer make a math operation to figure out where in  the allocated memory 10 elements up is?  (Say, multiply 10 x the amount of bytes needed for one element).

&#x200B;

If it has to 'crawl', that means it's time complexity is 'linear' no?  Like O(n).  Otherwise it would be O(1)?",1559618698

I'm working full time and would like to obtain a master's degree in computer science. I currently hold a bachelor's degree from a well known state university.

My employer will pay for a large portion of my masters on the condition that I complete it entirely online (I must work full time). Here are some online computer science programs I've found:

1) UIUC - Professional MCS. My second choice, not only because it is one of the highest ranked CS schools in the country, but because it only takes 2.5-4 yrs to complete.


2) GA Tech - OMSCS. From what I've read online, this absurdly cheap ($7000!) CS program is top notch, with high quality videos and resources included as part of the program. Plus the acceptance rate is fairly high.


3) Columbia CVN - MS Comp Sci... The Columbia video network provides the same exact degree as the on-site program. The Ivy League name brand is definitely a nice touch. It is quite pricey though.


4) Johns Hopkins - MS Comp Sci. Not in the top 25, but still an extremely good program. They have a really cool robotics lab too, so that's a plus.


5) Stanford - MS Comp Sci. My top choice for sure. Tied for #1 Comp Sci school in the country, but it's the only one with an online master's degree. According to their website, you had to be an employee at one of their ""member"" companies if you wanted to do an online masters through their HCP program. However, I just emailed someone from the department, and she said that this is **not** the case anymore.


**Are there any other top CS schools, other than these five, that offer online computer science (or robotics/AI) degrees?**

EDIT: Schools listed in comments:

6) Carnegie Mellon - Another #1 school. Only offers online degrees in Software Engineering, not computer science. Still a great choice for those who want to manage a team of software engineers one day.


Thank you!",1474579977

If you have any questions feel free to post them here or in the youtube link and I'll try to answer them.
I included a pre-trained classifier (svc.dat) in the github source but it has the possibility to train itself if you provide it with the data. ~~I did not upload that data on github in order to keep the number of files to a minimum. The training data for the classifier basically consists of a bunch of cropped candies.~~ LE. I also uploaded the training data.

first, why I am posting in this subreddit? Because mainly I'm looking for a tool to manage short code snippets and stuff like that (mainly in R, Python, SQL and friends (the data science family).
It should be simple and rather minimalistic. https://3cols.com/ comes close but I'm missing the named languages in the syntax highlighting.

AND: Ideally (if anything like this exist) I'm looking for more for a platform which is also kind of a general knowledge base. I'm often stumbling over a piece of information, a link, a picture, a text snippet and I've no clue where to put it in an organized manner. How are you people keeping that stuff organized? I know, not a classical computer science topic but I thought that the main intention of snippet organization would be sufficient to give it a try around here.

Thanks a lot!",1585616677

How do you not reach out to a customer who trusted you with this amount of money?  Is this who you want to be dealing with if/ when the shit really hits the fan in the cryptocurrency space ?   It is a total sham(e), I would have absolutely been a customer, and likely an active one long term.  For all those who have had positive experiences with Coinbase- that's great, but don't assume it will not happen to you at some point, especially when liquidity goes to hell after a crash.  If they can't help a newer customer willing to put in a large amount of funds, why will they help those who put in less. No, I did not deposit this amount without depositing a smaller amount first, which went through, so assumed the systems were fine, and hey worst case the wire is rejected ....  WRONG.  Don't assume it won't happen to you!!  Yes I filed a CFPB and state Financial Institutions complaint.  Yes I called a zillion times.  Yes I did everything they instructed on their ""customer support"" site. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this could happen in this country.  This company has reared its ugly face as a total fraud and/or perhaps a total Ponzi scheme.  How in the world do you return other wires from 5 days ago before addressing ones from more than a month ago, never mind the amount!  Let this be a warning to you all, I would not wish this on ANYONE.  

ADDENDUM: I attempted to transfer to my GDAX account, but the wire goes through the associated Coinbase account, and shows up as a Coinbase deposit (had transferred funds before), hence the references to Coinbase.

** UPDATE **:  I received an email today, Day #33, from GDAX support notifying me that they reviewed the case, and that they will re-send the funds back to the originating account.   
If they follow through, it will be confirmation that it truly is a manpower issue with Coinbase/ GDAX, and should be very encouraging to all with funds transfer problems.   I will update this post when/if funds are actually received back.

** UPDATE**:  Day #37- No funds received.  Received the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau response back today, Coinbase stated the following: 

""Company's Response
Hello Mr. ###, I am sorry for the recent troubles with your wire transfer and also the delay of an agent getting back to you. An agent was able to reach out to you via case ### regarding your issue. There was an issue processing the return of your wire, but another team looked into it and had the funds sent back to your bank. If you have not seen the funds or have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to above mentioned case and we can look into the matter further. Again, I am sorry for the recent issues with your wire transfer.""

At least that's what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes. The executive, who co-founded graphics-chip maker Nvidia, on Wednesday declared that ""Moore's Law isn't possible anymore.""

A key part of semiconductor manufacturing is shrinking the components called transistors, the extraordinarily tiny electronic switches that process data for everything from the clocks in microwave ovens to the artificial intelligence algorithms running in our phones.

Video: Nvidia CEO demos next-generation computer graphics at CES 2019

Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 predicted a steady, two-year cadence of chip improvements that would double a processor's performance every couple of years. Moore's Law became more than a guideline for computer processor manufacturing. It's instead evolved into a shorthand definition for innovation at regular intervals, and has become a self-fulfilling prophecy driving the tech industry. Those regular improvements in iPhones, Samsung Galaxy smartphones and various other devices are thanks to Moore's Law. 

But as the scale of chip components gets closer and closer to that of individual atoms, it's gotten harder to keep up the pace of Moore's Law. It's now more expensive and more technically difficult to double the number of transistors -- and in return, the processing power -- for a given chip every two years. 

""Moore's Law used to grow at 10X every five years [and] 100X every 10 years,"" Huang said during a Q&A panel with a small group of reporters and analysts at CES 2019. ""Right now Moore's Law is growing a few percent every year. Every 10 years maybe only 2X. ... So Moore's Law has finished.""

It's been five months, and having just made my last PF donation to the Internet Archive, I figure it might be a good time to say farewell.

I just want to thank everyone for supporting [this project](https://pineapplefund.org/). Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.

I kind of miss the old times when bitcoin was a small community, and you could count the number of 'altcoins' with one hand. Finding someone else who even *knows* about bitcoin was incredibly rare, and exchanges were semi-automated or running on PHP.

Every development since then makes Bitcoin stronger and better at solving the problems of the existing financial and monetary system. It's created a new generation of crypto early adopters, cypherpunks or technologists using cryptography to change the world; and now having the power and responsibility of capital.

5104 BTC was turned into $55 million for charities, from providing clean water, [open mapping](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2018/01/11/donation-from-pineapple-fund/), to clinical trials of [MDMA as treatment for PTSD](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/ecstasy-molly-ptsd-mdma.html). 

Thanks for following along with this experiment. I'm going to say goodbye now, but maybe there's room for dessert in a few years.

If you're ever blessed with crypto fortune, consider supporting what you aspire our world to be. :)

This script only works on Windows.

This script get windll libraries and uses them to create a process name list (mostly copied code). 

After the list is built, it is checked for Process names ""Advertisement"" and ""Spotify"" to see if an ad is playing. These names are specific to the moment when ad is being played in Spotify. 

The script is run in an interval, and does not fetch data real-time, so has small delays in runtime. As it is short and easily processed, does not load up CPU and doesn't leak memory.

The code: (Requires ctypes and pycaw libraries)


    import ctypes #process find
    import time   #sleep
    from pycaw.pycaw import AudioUtilities #mute

        GetWindowText = ctypes.windll.user32.GetWindowTextW

            if IsWindowVisible(hwnd):
                length = GetWindowTextLength(hwnd)
                buff = ctypes.create_unicode_buffer(length + 1)
                GetWindowText(hwnd, buff, length + 1)
                titles.append(buff.value)
            return True
        EnumWindows(EnumWindowsProc(foreach_window), 0)
        if ""Advertisement"" in titles:  #Spotify app is named as Advertisement
            sessions = AudioUtilities.GetAllSessions()
            for session in sessions:
                volume = session.SimpleAudioVolume
                volume.SetMute(1, None)
        elif ""Spotify"" in titles:      #App named as Spotify(Only when ad plays, else it's Spotify Free)
            sessions = AudioUtilities.GetAllSessions()
            for session in sessions:
                volume = session.SimpleAudioVolume

I am really interested in feedback on some places, as I believe I'm doing some actions too much, and would want to shorten it. It also mutes all processes at the moment, but I can't get to seem it to work a specific one yet (will try, but some help would be appreciated)).

Reddit, let's make history by crowdfunding an incredible treatment for PTSD, in bitcoin!",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pg1rh/4mil_will_fund_mdma_trials_for_ptsd_marked/,"Hi /r/Bitcoin!

You might've heard of PTSD. It's a debilitating illness usually affecting people who are _already_ victims, like sexual assault survivors who still suffer and are tormented every day since. Not only do they experience traumatic flashbacks, even sleep is no relief thanks to serious nightmares. It is life threatening. 

Existing treatment for PTSD aren't great. Therapy can be helpful, but they're often not enough, especially for severe PTSD. There are only two drugs approved by the FDA: SSRIs like Zoloft and Paxil. Those drugs must be taken continuously, and can cause serious side effects. Mania, seizures, inability to orgasm, and suicide are known side effects.

In 1986, a nonprofit named MAPS was started to develop legal contexts for beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana. 31 years later, MAPS has found its most promising candidate yet: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for PTSD. 

# The numbers: 68% (MDMA) versus 25% (placebo)

They've already conducted Phase 2 studies in the US, Canada, Israel, and Switzerland. After a comprehensive therapeutic process involving preparatory sessions, MDMA-assisted therapy sessions, and non-drug therapy sessions, **61% no longer met the criteria for PTSD**. This improved to **68%** after a year. Of those who met the criteria, many experienced significant reductions in symptoms. This is compared to only 25% for the placebo group, who received all the therapy, but with a sugar pill instead of MDMA.

For most people, the benefits are lasting. MAPS conducted one long-term outcome study, evaluating patients ~3.5 years after the last MDMA-assisted sessions. Average benefits even increased slightly over time.

> ""The MDMA sessions were the first time I'd ever felt love for myself. It was the first time I'd ever felt happy. I hugged my therapist and said 'Thank you.'""

After MAPS' studies, the FDA granted ['Breakthrough Therapy Designation'](https://www.maps.org/news/media/6786-press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd,-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials) to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

Now they need to conduct Phase 3 trials, which are far costlier due to requirements for an increased sample size, groups, etc, even through the stage with highest failure rates (Phase 2) is already over. MAPS has achieved the extra-ordinary journey of bringing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy all the way to Phase 3; a drug that pharmas will never touch because it will disrupt their recurring revenue streams of SSRIs.

# Phase 3

Phase 3 will cost about $25 million. They've raised $17 million already ($1 mil from PF included), and need another $8 million to get to the finish line. 

I have never donated to MAPS (or even heard of them) before starting the Pineapple Fund. PF donated $1 million, and that inspired another anonymous donator to **give another $1 million** in bitcoin. To whoever you are, you're amazing, and you are inspiring. <3

**I believe we, the cryptocurrency community, can fully fund Phase 3 trials**. Prescription MDMA could be a gift to this world from the bitcoin community.

If the trial succeeds, it could be approved as early as 2021. MAPS has created a public benefit corporation, fully owned by the non-profit, that would sell MDMA post-approval. This is a scalable and **financially sustainable** structure that could kickstart a renaissance in research into the therapeutic applications of many different psychedelics.

**Pineapple Fund will double the value of every donation to MAPS** from today until March 10th, up to $4 million. 

You can donate with bitcoin. It's like donating bitcoin for $30,000 each!

http://www.maps.org/donate-redirect/cryptocurrency

You can also donate with legacy payment systems like [credit cards or PayPal](https://store.maps.org/np/clients/maps/donation.jsp?campaign=103), and PF will also match that donation.

Your donations are tax deductible (if you're a US taxpayer), and you don't even have to pay capital gains tax. Ask for a receipt if so.

Let's make MDMA medicine a reality, and give the gift of an enjoyable life to those suffering from PTSD. If you believe that psychedelic drugs can have incredible therapeutic potential, then I believe this is one of the highest impact projects today.

And let's do it with cryptocurrency :)",1515624786

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions Segwit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy Segwit for everyone ASAP. Let's make it happen.


**Exchanges:** Find out if your exchange has deployed Segwit already. If not, politely request that they do so within 30-days or they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account with a Segwit deployed/ready exchange now

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a Segwit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a Segwit wallet. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to segwit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its Segwit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a Segwit address.

 via [HowToToken.com](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-segwit-transactions/):

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a Segwit Tx if the sending address is a Segwit address.

Is there a hardware wallet that does segwit addresses?

- Yes, Trezor supports Segwit by default. Ledger Nano also has support.

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

I asked you people if you are interested in learning Python by writing a Reddit bot some time back on r/learnprogramming. I received immense number of responses, so I'm posting it on r/python. It covers the process, practices and tools involved in writing a Reddit bot in Python.

Please post your feedback and questions in comments, and I'll be happy to answer them.

#**Requirements**:

1. You are somewhat familiar with programming in general, and have an idea about Python or other languages (like what are variables etc)
2. You  are on a Unix-like system with access to command line tools
3. Familiarity with [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) (Not really required...it is better if you are familiar)
4. A Reddit account

Even if you don't meet these requirements...no need to worry!

#**Introduction**

Writing a bot for Reddit is easier than you think, because Reddit provides a structured method to access its data via the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api). There are amazing tools like [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which can help simplify the process. PRAW is a Python wrapper for Reddit, and it takes the pain out of the process of writing a bot.


And as I said earlier, Python is an great language, which is easy to grasp for beginners. What even more amazing is it's community, which has made incredible open-source tools and libraries for almost anything. We will be using some of those, and you will realise how useful they are!

#**Important information - Please read**

1. While this post will cover a variety of programming topics, I highly encourage you to explore more. Go ahead and read the documentation of libraries used and think about how can you improve something in your project. I will possibly add more topics to this post.

2. Please **DO NOT CREATE SPAM** by letting your bot run on all of Reddit before you have thoroughly tested it. **r/test** exists for you to do all sorts of testing with your bot...please use it. Refer to [botiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette) and keeping in mind the type of bot you create, comply with the guidelines.

#**The code and resources**

I jus wrote a bot for Reddit, which posts a textual explanation of the popular webcomic [xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com) whenever it encounters an xkcd link. It is named **explainxkcdbot**. As of now, I have set my bot to run on r/test only to let you people test it all you want.


You can find the complete source code on my Github page - 
**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot**

Here is the code for the bot -
**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/explainxkcdbot.py**


#**How to run the bot**

The process is given here - https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/README.md

If you have any problems in running the bot, please let me know in the comments.


#**Let us begin**

We will move forward step-by-step in the code, and see what is going on.

##Section 1 - Importing libraries


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/e5e4f294b66adf1cb025a70a0392f847


This is the beginning of the program. Any line which begins with a `#` sign is a comment in Python, so it is not interpreted as code. Then we import the essential libraries required for out program. These libraries contain the methods (or functions) which we will use throughout our program. The syntax is pretty straightforward. Next we see 3 variables with some values assigned to them. More on them later.


##Section 2 - Authenticating


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/b941d04d8128e415d6630e961cc97988


This is where important things begin. Before proceeding, you should have a basic idea of what are **[classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)** and **[methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3786881/what-is-a-method-in-python)** in Python. One more important thing is an **object** - it is an instance of class, which holds the data variables declared in class and the **member functions work on these objects**. Please make a comment if you do not understand, I will try to explain.


`def authenticate():` defines a function which will try to authenticate the bot to Reddit. This is where PRAW comes into play as it provides us methods to do this. Remember we created a *praw.ini* file earlier. It is a configuration file that stores authentication credentials, so that you just call it whenever needed.


Next, we pass authentication parameters to `praw.Reddit()`. Here `explainbot` refers to the credentials in the configuration file, and `user_agent` is a descriptive string about your script/bot. This returns a [Reddit instance](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit_instance.html), which we assign to the variable `reddit`, and use this variable whenever we wish to authenticate.


Next up, we make a print statement to see who is getting authenticated i.e. the name. The `user` class in PRAW provides methods for the currently authenticated user. We call the method `me()` on `user` and then call it on the variable holding the Reddit instance for authentication, which in our case is `reddit`. So the statement becomes `reddit.user.me()`. We just use some [formatting in python](https://pyformat.info/) to print it.


Finally we `return` the variable `reddit`. Now i can use this `authenticate()` function in my program by calling it when I need it, and it will give me the variable `reddit`, which stores the Reddit instance.

------------------------------

**Important note 1:** Why did I create a function? It is because creating functions makes us easy to manage out code. We write separate functions for separate features of the program, and call them wherever needed. This breaks the code into manageable chunks, which makes it easy to read, modify and debug.

------------------------------

##Section 3 - Scraping


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/699123424e7b38da19d62e69339e859c


Next up is the function `def fetchdata(url)`. Notice how this function takes a parameter `url`. We pass this parameter whenever we call this function. The purpose of this function is to scrape/gather the data from the web, in order to post an explanation.


**Now scraping is not a very reliable process**, but sometimes we just have to do it. We go to a website, go through it's HTML source, and extract the text, links etc. that we want. Here we use **[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#make-a-request)** library to make a web request, and **[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)** to extract the data.


`r = requests.get(url)` gives a Response object called `r`. We can get all the information we need from this object. Then we call the method `content` on `r`, and pass it to `soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')`, which gives us a `soup` object with which we can retrieve elements of a web page. Read more [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).


Now what happens depends on what are you scraping. Every website has different type of content, and you should go through the HTML to see how can you retrieve what you want. In my case http://explainxkcd.com has it's explanation inside the first few `<p>` tags, so I look for the first `<p>` tag by `tag = soup.find('p')`. Also, immediately after the explanation ends, `<h2>` tag follows, so I know where to stop. Now take a look here-

    while True:
        if isinstance(tag, bs4.element.Tag):
            if tag.name == 'h2':
                break
            if tag.name == 'h3':
                tag = tag.nextSibling
            else:
                data = data + '\n' + tag.text
                tag = tag.nextSibling
        else:
            tag = tag.nextSibling

I continue to look through the tags, and store textual data in a `string` named `data` and move to the next tag. I `break` the process if I encounter `<h2>` because I know that is where explanation ends. The code depends on the structure of website you are scraping. Finally, I return `data`, so that now when I call the function like `fetchdata('http://explainxkcd.com/1024')` for example, it returns me the explanation of comic 1024 as a `string` named `data`.

----------------

**Important note 2:** Scraping is unreliable. If the website changes it's structure, you have to change your code. In this case, it can still include some tags which we don't want. The line `if (tag.name == 'h3')` in the above function is for handling one such unexpected situation I encountered on http://explainxkcd.com. This is why we like to have APIs. 

--------------------------


##Section 4 - Using regular expressions, parsing URLs, handling exceptions and preventing duplicate submissions


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/700db3e46770d13fe89356d0fa4f570d


This function which takes a parameter which is a Reddit instance (remember that Reddit instance from Section 1). Again we use PRAW to get one or more subreddits, and go through their comments. See [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit/subreddits.html) and [here](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html).

You can pass multiple subreddits like `for comment in reddit.subreddit('test+learnprogramming+pics')`.

**Regular Expressions**: Now I want to extract xkcd links from the comments, so I need to look for a pattern for the URL. xkcd links are of the form `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]`. So we make use of regular expressions from the `re` library to match the pattern. [More about regular expressions](https://regexone.com/references/python).

    match = re.findall(""https://www.xkcd.com/[0-9]+"", comment.body)
        if match:
            print(""Link found in comment with comment ID: "" + comment.id)
            xkcd_url = match[0]

Here I look for all strings that are like `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]` using the method `findall` from [user comments](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html), and if it matches, it returns a list with the matching URL, and we store our URL in the variable `xkcd_url`.

----------------

**Important note 3:** Try to find out regular expressions (regex) to improve this program. What happens if a user posts 'https://xkcd.com/1024' or http version as 'http://www.xkcd.com/1024'. These are still valid xkcd URLs. There can be some other cases where the URL might be placed between a bunch of symbols in a comment. Try to modify the regex statement so that it can detect these cases as well.

--------------------------


**URL parsing**: Now I have an xkcd URL. I have 2 immediate objectives now- 

Objective 1. To extract the comic number at the end of the URL. We use [urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html) for this purpose.

    url_obj = urlparse(xkcd_url)
            xkcd_id = int((url_obj.path.strip(""/"")))

Objective 2. Form a complete **explainxkcd.com** URL, which I will pass as a parameter to the function `fetchdata(url)` (See Section 2)

    myurl = 'http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/' + str(xkcd_id)

Both objectives are thus complete.

**Preventing duplicate submissions and Exception handling**: The bot needs to make sure it replies to every comment only once. There are many methods you can try which include using a separate key-value database like [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), but we will use a simpler approach.


Just create a text file (remember commented.txt), store the comment ID of a comment in it when you  visit a relevant comment, and verify if a comment ID already exists in that file before making new comments. Remember to put the location of the text file in the `path` variable (from Section 1), so that you can pass it to the method `open()`.


Now, what happens when a user makes a comment like 'https://www.xkcd.com/689243348723'. This xkcd does not exist, but the program will extract '689243348723', then form a link like http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/689243348723, and pass it to the function `fetchdata(url)`. Now **the function will return an exception and your program will stop/crash**. You need to take care of these situations.

This is achieved using `try`, `except` and `else` blocks. [See here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) Here is the code for these 2 steps-

    file_obj_r = open(path,'r')
                        
            try:
                explanation = fetchdata(myurl)
            except:
                print('Exception!!! Possibly incorrect xkcd URL...\n')
                # Typical cause for this will be a URL for an xkcd that does not exist (Example: https://www.xkcd.com/772524318/)
            else:
                if comment.id not in file_obj_r.read().splitlines():
                    print('Link is unique...posting explanation\n')
                    comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)
                    
                    file_obj_r.close()

                    file_obj_w = open(path,'a+')
                    file_obj_w.write(comment.id + '\n')
                    file_obj_w.close()
                else:
                    print('Already visited link...No reply needed\n')


Notice how I make a reply to a relevant comment by using the variables from Section 1 to print header and footer description alongside the explanation - `comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)`


Next we make some `sleep` statements to stop the bot from querying Reddit too fast. If the Reddit API returns an error due to too many requests, adjust `val` in the instances of `time.sleep(val)` in your program.


##Section 5: The main function


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/99323ebd710428f4590077a844236f83


We are almost done here. We wrap our functions into a `main` function by calling `authenticate()` (remember Section 1) and passing it to the function which runs the bot, namely `run_explainbot(reddit)`. Since we are calling it inside `while` loop with the expression 'True', it will run indefinitely.


#My bot in action


Test post to show the bot in action: https://redd.it/6tey71 (Since I'm not running it continuously as of now, it won't reply to every comment containing an xkcd link there)

**Finally, if you want to take this project further, you are welcome to contribute code to [my Github repository](https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot). You can fork it (please note that there are still some checks to be added in order to make the bot more Reddit friendly) or open a pull request.** I'll try to add more details about file handling and scraping aspects of the program once I get some time.

Hi r/python,

Redditor of 10+ years here.

I've started teaching live & realtime, using Youtube Live & Facebook Live, and an extension-based IDE.

The group sessions are lots of fun. You can find one [here](https://www.facebook.com/codebasetech/videos/400550887157128).

So far I'm on meetup.com, and Facebook. Reddit is my next big step (please be nice to me, i've invested a lot of my time and effort into this).

I do have paying members, but am putting out content for free, and am not entirely decided on whether to be a paying service or a free service (only been up since November).

You can either join us on Codebase for a live Python session at 7pm London time this Sunday: [https://fb.com/codebasetech](https://fb.com/codebasetech) or if this post gains enough traction, i'll see if i can embed a live video in reddit, so we can have live sessions either in this sub, or in /r/codebase.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks,

I’d been wanting to build a project like this for awhile and used it as an excuse to get familiar with Python. 

Using a throwaway since I cannot change my Spotify username

The playlist is here: https://open.spotify.com/user/1285950058/playlist/0d8k1FfVCrCZUnSXTcAlUE

The playlist is generated from crawling the first 10 pages of the songs on this list: https://www.besteveralbums.com/topratedstats.php?o=track

The playlist is set to update every day, though I don't know how much this list changes over time. 

There's some limitations, however:

* If the song isn't on Spotify, there's not much I can do about that.
* If the text of the song doesn't match the name of the song exactly on Spotify, the song won't get added to the playlist. (I'm trying to figure out a way to make the search results more accurate)
* I could not get the crawler to actually add the songs in order, so the order right now is random

Using this method, I was able to accurately add 84 out of the top 100 songs on this list.

I'd love to hear your feedback, and feel free to follow the playlist!

I am a first computer science student and I've been doing a lot of research in machine learning and AI. I find it interesting and maybe a prospective field of study. Unfortunately, the machine learning classes at my university are still a year off of where I am.

I've currently taken an intro CS class and data structures. I'm starting into systems now. I am proficient in C, C++, and Python.

I was wondering, what's the best way to get started learning this stuff on my own? There are a few guides on Python ML online, but they mostly use libraries that I don't know, and I find myself just copying and pasting what they have. I'd like to work from the ground up, so I can actually see what's going into all of this.

For example, I saw a demo of a guy who set up a program to play Super Mario World on its own, taking inputs, playing the level, learning where it dies and what it takes to get past it. He somewhat explained the neural network, but it's still conceptually ambiguous to me, because I don't know what's going on at a base level.

Does anyone have any resources or tips to get me into ML at a very basic level? Any help is greatly appreciated!",1528165739

**BREAKING -- the scam websites (x7) are now offline thanks to the work/complaints from this post**
**TLDR: Don't trust new wallets unless you're 100% sure or you will lose everything**

First off, Yes - I feel sheepish, yes had I spent more time researching it wouldnt of happened, Yes I realize that I am a moron for letting **$70K USD** slip out of my hands, so please dont remind me of that, I learned that lesson.  The website was legit looking, I trusted it wouldnt come from googles top searches pointing to Reddit which then pointed to a scam from this user > https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1

Secondly, I lost my BTC after importing a private key (after I had sent my funds to a new wallet) into a wallet downloaded from electrumbtcp,com (DO NOT GO HERE.) I then transferred my funds BACK into Exodus but mistakenly didn't create a NEW address by clicking the ARROW on the right.  This mistake cost me $70K USD.

I got into cryptocurrency a few years ago, but not in a heavy sense, just as a merchant accepting BTC. I ran a large minecraft server and a small portion of our user base shopped in BTC back when it was $200-300.  While this didn't give me anywhere near the $70K that I lost, it got me started.  I then invested what I could into ETH early on and hodl'd it as long as possible.  I wouldn't consider myself a ""newbie"" at trading, investing or mining for awhile.  I've done several forked coins and I didn't, in my wildest dreams, think that it'd be a malicious wallet.  I've been trained to ""Send coins, get the private key - send funds back to newly created address"" - I thought thats what I was doing.  

I know my funds are probably gone forever, I want to know how I can warn others, how I can report this to (whatever? country authorities) as a malicious website.  I'm not looking for attention as much as I'm looking for possible help with bringing down this website.

For ref heres the wallet that stole my funds:

**Can I get a upvote for awareness?**

**If you lost BTC and have the (https://www.electrumbtcp.com/download/Electrum-Private-windows-x32-1.0.2.exe) please post it on mediafire and send it to me for evidence/analyzing**

* Edit 1: I have reported this to the French authorities (Though I am a USA resident I dont think anything will happen with it).  I appreciate the kind words. 

* Edit 2: Any french law enforcement or lawyers that want to help?

* Edit 3: After searching ""BTCP Wallet"" the reddit post came up > https://i.imgur.com/7hT0nCL.png The user  https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1 posted about it that it ""was already available"", I realize this was my fault for not fact checking this.

* Edit 4: User is spending the BTC now > https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/1EgaeuKXBs1kJGx68JtqhxeDGLsAxkDfbx/ 5.0 sent to address https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/17PJew5bTxscbFGpL6MFTmZMM95mvjNFJL/

* Edit 5: should I even bother reporting this to the FBI / police? Will they try to pin me for fraud or something for not reporting buying BTC? (crazy I know but I dont want a double hit here...)

* Edit 6: It looks like user (jhkansen1) here on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1) is alerting everyone to navigate to the scam website.  **Can I get in contact to find his IP / authorities?** https://i.imgur.com/pk0Tw7r.png - it looks like its the same user that scammed people out of BCH and BTG - the same websites that are using the ""electrum X . org/com"" variables.  These scammers seem to be pretty big and unconfronted, which doesnt make me feel good about where things are in the crypto realm.

* Edit 7: Friendly and nice advice from an investing group on how to track / what to do:
>@Kainzo sorry to hear this. I’m sure you know this information already but watch these wallets carefully (below). They contain all your BTC. Try to see if you can set reminders or notifications on them to monitor activity. These wallets contain all your BTC (they won’t add up to the same amount due to transaction fees). The pattern of the transfers definitely seem programmatic so I doubt you are the only victim. That being said, the scammers are human, too. Not sure if they’ll HODL or want to liquidate in this dip. If they liquidate, then they will either 1) send to an exchange (you’ll be able to identify wallet addresses that are linked to an exchange so keep an eye out for activity) in which case once you notice the activity you should alert the exchange immediately, or 2) they will sell it off locally with a platform like local bitcoins, in which case it will be highly improbable to trace. If it is option 1, if the exchange cooperated with you, then you may be able to retrieve your lost funds. Fiat-to-coin exchanges like Coinbase should be on your side as they are under strict regulation to avoid processing dirty money, and they are well aware of this. I doubt, though, that the scammers will go the online dump route, due to the transparency and risk I just mentioned, but at this point it’s still worth the watch. Even if they go on some other exchange, still contact the exchange immediately. Because in that case they may be trying to transfer out in something like Ethereum, and you will have no way of tracking it once it leaves the exchange.

* Edit 8: Another mod from Cosmic Trading on Discord
>@Kainzo wallet addresses associated with exchanges will usually be dumped into a central wallet owned by the exchange or some subwallet that is also owned by the exchange, which contains other people’s bitcoin too. If blockchain.info recognizes the address it will display which exchanges wallet it is. If not you can try to google the wallet address you suspect to be and exchange and it should provide some transparency.
You can try to alert authorities to identify the user who stole from you but it is unlikely they will be able to do anything about it since the scammer probably resides outside your country and law enforcement only has jurisdiction within, unless your case is escalated to some FBI equivalent in France
Even so, it is unlikely they will escalate or prosecute for a financial crime this size. Not saying $70k is small by any means, but the type of cases they deal with are more money laundering to the extent of millions

* Edit 9: Someone asked me to post my LTC address (LXzurqezb6PZsnJvoyiYfD5HnzLhFf6nPh)

* Edit 12: Trying to get a list of Crypto Exchange support emails to alert them of the fraud BTC that could be coming into the exchange.
* Edit 13: Someone compiled a list of all the accounts used by the scammer - these should be hunted down by Reddit and others to be removed so others dont fall prey to this scheme.

5748,C59OGN9FBIKWBGSQX6JI3POD3,Bastiat,"Day 5: I will post this guide regularly until available solutions like SegWit & order batching are mass adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low. User demand from this community can help lead to some big changes. Have you joined the /r/Bitcoin SegWit effort?",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7mk8az/day_5_i_will_post_this_guide_regularly_until/,"**SUMMARY**

Segregrated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24, 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work. If users demand SegWit now it will temporarily releive the transaction backlog while bigger solutions like Lightning are developed.

**BACKGROUND**

Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

 [Source](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

- Draw your own conclusions based on their own words: 

 [March 2016 - Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reservations about Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)

I was accepted to the Masters of Science in Data Science program at Harvard and to the Masters of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, and I am trying to decide where to go.

At Georgia Tech I could have a concentration in Machine Learning so the courses I would take wouldn't be too significantly different between the two places. It seemed like Harvard had some more pure statistics classes but this isn't a problem to me as I enjoy stats. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing in terms of post-graduate opportunities. I plan to get a job after graduating instead of continuing to a PhD immediately. I may return eventually but a PhD wouldn't be my immediate goal.

The program at Harvard is new. I would only be the second year accepted to it, so I don't really know if this is a good or bad thing. I can't expect it would be bad as it's Harvard. I do wonder if Georgia Tech's program that has been around for longer than just two years might be more known and respected than this new program at Harvard. But at the same time everyone has heard of Harvard and knows it is a great school.

In terms of rankings, Georgia Tech is #8 and Harvard is #16 in the US News and World Report rankings for graduate computer science. I'm not sure how important the name of Harvard is or the #8 ranking of Georgia Tech is to potential employers. I'm sure either school would be great and will open many doors for me, but I'm just looking for any advice or insight or anyone that has any experience with either school.",1554760729

When you submit something, you'll be prompted to select a flair. u/AssistantBOT will help - you can reply to the bot with a flair option.

Here are the flairs I have set up:

* News - for python releases, end of life notifications, updates on what Guido is doing, etc
* Discussion - for discussing Python events, python development, etc
* Help - This one is a trap. If you select it, your post will get removed and you'll receive a polite message directing you to r/LearnPython and the Python discord. Ideally this will prevent the front page help spam
* I Made This - this is contentious, but I believe that people should be allowed to show off what they've worked on. To start with, this will be allowed at all times. 
* Resource - if you find a cool library to use, awesome book to read, etc.
* Editors / IDEs - for discussion about ~~pycharm and vim~~ I guess any editor
* Web Development - a specific topic of discussion
* Machine Learning - a specific topic of discussion
* Big Data - a specific topic of discussion
* Finance - a specific topic of discussion
* Systems / Operations - a specific topic of discussion
* Testing - a specific topic of discussion
* Meta - for discussion pertaining to r/Python itself

I've based this on the sorts of things I have observed in r/Python over the last 8 months. This is not an exhaustive list, and it could potentially be reduced or expanded as necessary. Please feel free to discuss the flair here or in a [Meta] post.

For instructions on filtering, check out our wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/wiki/filters 

This is a bit rough; I've copied it from another subreddit, and tried to rapidly edit in relevant things. If you experience an error with it, please let me know.

Next steps:

* I'm planning to have a moderator application form ready by end of week, and I'll start looking for more moderators.
* I'll try to keep the modqueue clear until we add more people.
* Please report things that slip through, especially things that are more appropriate for r/learnpython. Please keep in mind that ""I made this"" style posts are *explicitly allowed* even if you don't like them, so don't report them; filter them out instead.

Edit: I forgot something:

Do not take this as criticism of Bitcoin, blockchain technology, or cryptocurrency users & developers, it's not.

There are probably other factors that led to my brother's suicide, but he had been beating himself up over Bitcoin for the past several years to the point where he seemed constantly depressed over it and gradually became a shadow of his former happy self.

He claimed to have owned 15,000 at one point, which may have been an exaggeration. But I know for a fact that at some point around October-November 2012 he did have at least 6,000 BTC which he showed me in his wallets. He was so enthusiastic about Bitcoin and how cryptocurrencies would revolutionize the financial world. For awhile he was annoying the fuck out of our relatives about how it would make them millionaires.

I'm not sure exactly what happened to his BTC. Sometime in 2013 he claimed to have lost most of them in a hack and sold the remainder too early. He very well may have sold them all too early, but who knows.

 As the price took off in late 2013-early 2014 you could tell he was distraught over it and became increasingly withdrawn from family and friends. Whenever I did manage to contact him he would sometimes end up ranting about how badly he had fucked up and how he would never have a chance to be rich again.

As the price climbed up to 10k over the past several months it became even more difficult to make contact with him, he just wouldn't reply to me or my parents calls and texts. A couple weeks ago my parents flew out to see my brother and found him dead by suicide with no note. He was 29 with 50 years of life ahead of him.

Other than obvious grief I don't really know how to feel about this. If I had missed out on $50M I might have killed myself too. I can't imagine what my brother must have been feeling these past several years knowing he missed his best & easiest shot at the wealthy life he had always fantasized about. Bitcoin totally fucked up his mindset to the point where you couldn't talk about anything related to investing, money or finances without him storming off or crying.

If there's any more of you in a similar situation feel free to PM me. Please try to recognize there are endless economic opportunities in life and 1 mistake doesn't define your future. There are family and friends who care about you and will listen.",1512469378

All tutorials are free in both text and video forms.

The latest series that I have put out is [Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/). The aim of this series is to show what can be done with Python in the field of finance and algorithmic trading using data science (spoiler alert: a lot!). 

Even though you probably aren’t going to get rich, you might save yourself a lot of money (when you back test your silly trading idea and realize it’s bad), and you’ll learn about statistics and data science with Python along the way. 

I start the series off with a simplistic introduction to using Python+[Pandas](https://pythonprogramming.net/data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial-introduction/)+[Matplotlib](https://pythonprogramming.net/matplotlib-intro-tutorial/)  to get stock data, visualize stock data, and to manipulate this data. 

From here, we get into Quantopian, which is a Python-based platform built on top of the Zipline library for back-testing, but has since expanded out to enable quite a bit more than that.

We use Quantopian both for simplistic back testing, but also for doing research into future trading strategies, since Quantopian also provides a bunch of free data like minute pricing data, fundamentals along with tools like [Alphalens](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens) for analyzing various factors that you believe to be beneficial to a trading strategy.

If you would like to check it out, the series starts here: 
[Python for Finance introduction](https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/)

If you are already familiar with Pandas and want to jump straight into the strategies and using Quantopian for back-testing and research:

For the uninitiated, Hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin. 10 coins from Satoshi.",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jsp0s/one_of_the_last_posts_made_by_hal_finney_on/,"I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.",1513297953

Have you done your part?",Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rrb3w/day_9_i_will_post_this_guide_regularly_until/,"**BACKGROUND**

Segregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, and the majority of users have not made the switch themselves.

On Dec 18 2017 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:
 [If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

Mass SegWit use alone could empty the mempool, result in blocks that are not completely full, and make it possible to include transactions with $0 fee once again. 

[On Jan 11 2018 when BTC sends went offline at Coinbase the mempool began to rapidly empty. Later in the day when service was restored there was a sharp spike up in the mempool](https://twitter.com/JordanTuwiner/status/951698069967589376). Subsequently, that afternoon Brian Armstrong finally had to break his silence on the topic and admitted Coinbase is working on SegWit but has still not deployed it. It appears that this is an important data point that indicates if just a few major exchanges would deploy SegWit the high fees bitcoin is experiencing would be eliminated.

SegWit is just one technique available to exchanges and users to reduce pressure on the Bitcoin network. You can make the switch to SegWit on your next transaction, and pressure exchanges to deploy SegWit NOW along with other actions that will reduce their transaction impact on the network. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

________________


**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. If your wallet is not committed to implementing SegWit fast, speak out online any way you can and turn up the pressure. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit.
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Contact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch. Use social media to point out the benefits of SegWit adoption.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**BEYOND SEGWIT - BATCHING, PAYMENT CHANNELS, LIGHTNING**


Batching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it. Users should demand this or walk.

Beyond SegWit & Batching, Lightning Network integration will have even more effect. Lightning is now active and exchanges could setup payment channels between each other so that on-chain transactions need not take place. Some ideas have to outline how that might work are here: [Google Doc - Lightning Exchanges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r38-_IgtfOkhJh4QbN7l6bl7Rol05qS-i7BjM3AjKOQ/edit). Which two bitcoin exchanges will be the first to establish a lightning channel between themselves and offer free/instant transfers between them for their customers? This will happen in 2018

**FAQs**

###### If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

> No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unnecessary transactions for now. 

###### Why is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?

> SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn't been a priority.

###### Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?

> Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.

###### What determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?

> Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. 

###### Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

> The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download the latest version of Electrum to generate a SegWit address.

> A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

> A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

> A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

> [Source: HowToToken](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)

###### What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

> Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

> Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

###### Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
> The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
###### Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

> Draw your own conclusions based on their own words: 

> [March 2016 - Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reservations about Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)

> [Dec 2017 - Coinbase is STILL working on Segwit](https://blog.coinbase.com/bitcoin-segwit-update-3ab0484e4526)

**P2SH/bech32 FAQs**

###### What are the two SegWit address formats and why do they exist?

> It's been a challenge for wallet developers to implement SegWit in a way that users can easily and without too much disruption migrate from legacy to SegWit addresses. The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses – Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress – use so-called “nested P2SH addresses.” This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address – starting with a “3” – and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to exist wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.

> Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.

>  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)

###### What is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?

> P2SH starts with ""3...""

> bech32 starts with ""bc1...""
 
###### Which addresses can I send from/to?

> P2SH Segwit addresses can be sent to using older Bitcoin software with no Segwit support. This supports backward compatibility

> bech32 can only be sent to from newer Bitcoin software that support bech32. Ex: Electrum

> [Source: BitcoinTalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2347427.msg23976364#msg23976364)

###### Why did ThePirateBay put up two Bitcoin donation addresses on their frontpage, one bech32 and one not? 

> The address starting with a ""3..."" is a P2SH SegWit address that can be sent BTC from any bitcoin address including a legacy address. The address starting with a ""bc1..."" is a bech32 SegWit address that can only be sent to from newer wallets that support bech32.

I think it might be in the system as Causal Economic Analysis but we'll get that fixed.

The class covers the use of the statistical programming language R (which is looking pretty darn good in the job market these days, by the way), and also how to perform causal inference. Causal inference means using data to answer questions like ""Does X cause Y?"" e.g.  Does the minimum wage harm jobs? Will the new company policy increase profits? Does university prestige raise your earnings? This stuff is economists' bread and butter, and it's a big reason why so many tech companies are hiring economists these days. We cover what causality *is* and a set of methods for uncovering it.

There's no textbook to buy, and the only prereq is either ECON 100, 201, or 202 (i.e. ""take any econ class""). Coursework includes homework, some exams, and a couple of very short papers (1-2 pages). The course counts as a 300-level elective. You'll probably still get something out of it even if you've already taken other econometrics classes (340 or 440).

You can see pretty much all the course materials [here](http://nickchk.com/econ305.html) (which includes video resources) to check if you might be interested. You can see me discussing the philosophy behind the class [here](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1114956341913645058) (plus some bonus nice words about the course from Justin Wolfers!

I currently know C, and a bit of C#.

At the end of the year, I'm planning to have learned python, java, javascript and C++. Im very good at coming up with solutions for problems.

However, I want to take it to the next step. I want to get ahead of the game and learn as much as I need about programming before I go to university. I want to Excell and ultimately get a job offer as a computer scientist before graduating from university.

I have the passion and motivation to improve. I know I do. However, I lack experience as a computer scientist, and I also don't know what concepts will be taught in university (so I don't know what to study/improve).

I have experience in robotics competitions, and game development. I think I have a decent resume already.

With that being said, what do you recommend I learn? 
What tips do you have for me?
What should I study / expect?

Please contact your department heads, so we can open up the opportunity to have the option for Pass/NoPass for us individuals who are being hit harder by this COVID-19 Virus. This would be an ideal **OPTION** because individuals who want to keep their GPA grade may, while others can receive the Pass Credit

At this time, there are no plans to convert classes to credit/no credit. That said, we recognize that this unprecedented situation that we are facing can make it difficult to concentrate on academics. We also understand that the impact of virtual instruction varies from student to student and that it can be particularly difficult for some classes.*

*I encourage you to work closely with your faculty to express your concerns and obtain guidance on how to finish the semester successfully. If you are not receiving the support that you need from your faculty, please contact the department chair.

5866,DCB58FLQ4E06NTEOBIPX924YF,diners_driveins_dive,[Rant] I feel pretty cheated paying for this mock interview through Gainlo. F@#&ing scam,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7wmp0k/rant_i_feel_pretty_cheated_paying_for_this_mock/,"I've been preparing for an on-site interview with Microsoft for a new grad position (SDE 59?) almost every night for the past month in between classwork and felt pretty confident solving medium questions on leetcode. So I wanted to get some real feedback from actual developers in the industry/at big companies to see if I was up-to-par with entry level expectations.

I went through Gainlo and got matched with a senior engineer supposedly from Oracle for $150. He literally [asked me a leetcode question](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/description/) and basically didn't accept an answer that didn't match the top one even if the algorithm was the same. While I was coding he was typing away and chuckling about something on his end. When I would ask him a clarifying question or explaining my algorithm he just said ""uh-huh"" or ""yes"" occasionally and was overall just not engaged.

I finished coding a solution about 30 minutes in and he hurriedly tried to wrap up the interview because I'm sure he's paid per interview without any standards. All he told me was that it wasn't the most optimal solution, it didn't compile, that I should try to study more, work on my resume. His advice was read up on AVL trees(?), ubiquitous computing, SQL joins, bit manipulation, and some other obscure stuff which made it seem like he was totally out of touch with how interviews work now. To top it all off, he sent me some follow up feedback template with some high level, generic tips in all of the sections and the ""correct"" solution which really showed he was just winging it.

When I complained to Jake/Gainlo, they said that they could not arbitrate and that it was my word against his and that he had worked with them for a very long time and that this never happens. Jake basically said that I was being too sensitive about the feedback and that the best he could offer was a 50% discount on the next interview, which I assume would be with an even more novice interviewer. 

[Proof](https://imgur.com/BJe6dHk)

**TLDR: All they care about is the short term and raking in money. NO QUALITY. SCAM AS HELL**

If you're reading this ""Jake"", screw you. If I had done even a modicum of research I would've seen this coming. Even the broken English was a dead giveaway.",1518311748

My friend told me about PyGame, and I decided to try to write an entire game in it.  I want to tell you the order I did things in, as I think you might find it interesting, and maybe try it yourself some time!

**Background:**

Epikos is an RPG I'd been wanting to make for years, but never really had the time to make.  Python, however, writes really expressive code and can really accelerate dev time.  I feel like I can write code 50X faster in Python than in C++.

Since I have a day job, this had to be a project which I could do after work.  Entire thing took about two years, including making all the assets for the game and all the tools.  Workload was about 2 hours after work each day, and a lot more time on the weekends.

**Step 1:  Making the tools for the game**

For reference, game screenshots can be seen here:

First, I made what I call a ""console.""  It's a bit like a DOS or Linux shell.  I wanted this so I could type commands into my game and the toolset used to create the game.  It doesn't look like much, but here is an example of what the console looks like:

**The Paint Program:**

Next, the game needed a program to create sprite art in.  I could have used photoshop, aesprite, or any number of paint programs, but I wanted to make my own custom sprite animation tool, and I wanted it in Python.  I had barely done any python coding at this point, but even then the paint tool took only a couple of days to write.  It's called tilemake, and it looks like this:

As you can see, this paint tool uses the console, which I had built first.  In the above example, I have loaded the ""knight"" sprite, which is used for one of the main characters in the game.  The tool shows you multiple zoomed in versions of the sprite (""mips"") and you can paint on any one of them, using the CGA color palette.  You can also animate the sprites in this very tool.

I got a lot of milage out of this tool, as the game has 826 sprite frames in it, all made with this very paint program.

**The Map Editor:**

Now, my game needed 2D maps.  Since I had some art made with the paint program, it was time to arrange this art in the form of a map.  The map editor looks like this:

There are several components to this editor, but keep in mind I'm sticking 100% to Python.  In the main view, you can zoom and scroll about with the mouse, and paint using several different sized brushes.

You can see a column to the right which says ""natural"".  This shows all the sprites which are used in a natural environment.  There are other categories, such as indoors, dungeon, etc.  Categories were important, since I have many, many different sprites.

Finally, on the bottom you can see our old friend, the console.

**Step 2:  The Game Itself:**

Once you have the map editor, making a game isn't really that different, it just has gameplay logic.  Most of it is really simple, this includes combat logic, movement, etc.  I'm not going to go into the details of these since writing them in Python should be fairly trivial, but ask me if you want something explained in greater detail.  I will, however, go over some highlights and gotchas:

**AStar (A*):**

A* is a common AI algorithm used for pathing.  Implementing it in Python is pretty easy.  Python reads a lot like pseudocode, and A* can be found on wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

That code isn't really very different from Python is it?  As an excercise, you can try pasting that into Python and see what you need to change.  Hint:  not much.  Shouldn't take you more than half an hour to get some good AI pathing going.

**Save/Load with Pickle:**

I *love* pickle, and used it for save/loading.  It's a standard Python module, so if you haven't used it yet you should check it out.  One gotcha was that saveing and loading maps was too expensive in pickle, so I compressed the maps first with basic dictionary encoding, and then used pickle on them.

When writing save/load, make sure to include version filtering or some mechanism so that if you change file formats later on, older files are automatically updated.  You don't want your players to lose progress just because you patched and changed savegame format!

**Font?:**

There are several legal issues surrounding the use of fonts on a cross-platform title, and I really didn't want to bother with that.  I couldn't find a good free font which matched my art style, so I created my own font for my game.  If you can do this, I recommend it, because then you own it and can use it forever.

**Music:**

One thing I didn't write from scratch was the music authoring software.  Audio isn't really my expertise, but I wanted NES sounding music.  I ended up using this:

http://famitracker.com/

Famitracker is a fun way to write NES-sounding music, and indeed it actually writes to the nes file format.  Of course, PyGame can't play this, so I converted it to .ogg format.  Why .ogg?  I found that other supported formats tended to crash pygame, so I recommend that one.

**Sound FX:**

Similarly, I wanted an old-school feeling for my sound FX.  Authoring these in famitracker didn't seem that efficient, but someone showed me a tool called bfxr:

http://www.bfxr.net/

This let me create all kinds of sounds for my game.  For more complicated sounds, I needed to fallback to famitracker, but 90% of the sounds were in bfxr.

**Shipping the Game:**

I couldn't ship raw .py files, so I used pyinstaller to turn my game into a single .exe file.  I had tried python2exe, but couldn't get it to work very well with pygame.  Maybe you can have better luck with python2exe, but I'd recommend pyinstaller.  PyInstaller uses another library called setupTools.  For some reason, my .exe wouldn't work with the latest version of setupTools (gave an error and immediately quit), so I had to do this:

pip install setuptools==19.2

That gives you the older version, which should work.

The last part of shipping is making the .exe and game assets into an installer.  For this I used something called NSIS.  Sadly, I can't recommend you use this at this point, since it was on Sourceforge and if you go there now you'll probably get viruses and malware (RIP Sourceforge).  If you happen to have an older version of NSIS, I recommend backing it up on your google drive, since re-downloading it is not an option.

**Conclusion:**

While there were some gotchas, I didn't have too much trouble making a small-scale game 100% in Python, and it was a suitable project to do after work, even while working a full-time job.  

Happy coding!

**Edit:**

Thank you for the Reddit gold.  This has inspired me to share some other misc info with you now:

*  One huge advantage of Python is that porting from Windows to Linux only took an afternoon.  I did it all on virtualbox running Mint.  In fact, setting up virtualbox to run Mint was harder than porting the game.  There were two gotchas.  First, if you're using time.clock() on windows, make sure to change it to time.time() on Linux.  Second, some of the backslashes in filenames needed to be changed to forward slashes.  That's it!!!

*  If you are on Windows, I recommend trying the Python plug-in for Visual Studio.  I didn't actually use it while developing my game, but I think it would have helped from time to time.  It gives breakpoints, variable watch, and callstack info.
