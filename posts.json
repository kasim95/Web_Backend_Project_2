I will be interviewing people and businesses from different demographics to try to find an issue that we are passionate about. Then pitching some end users the idea and begin developing.\n\nI thought it would be cool to do this with some other people as well (probably remotely). If any money is made from the application I was planning on donating it to a local non-profit.\n\nI plan on working 60-80 hours a week on it in order to get it to a production level state but I wouldn't expect anyone else to do the same. Something closer to 5-10 hours a week would probably suffice.\n\nOr if you could offer guidance through the process that would be great too. I am currently in college (4th year with two 6 month internships) and just want to get better\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFAQ:\n\n1. What is the tech stack?\n\n\\* That will depend on the project. Based on the project the tech stack that makes the most sense based on the research that is made will be the one that is used\n\n2. What will the project be?\\* We will brainstorm ideas based on the interviews that are done with businesses\/residents in the first week\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Project Break Down**\n\n**Week 1: Survey**Will be surveying people\/businesses with the goal of finding an issue we could be passionate in tackling. Once we have a couple ideas they will be pitched to our end users (people\/businesses that we surveyed).\n\n**Week 2-6: Software Design\/Graphic Design\/Software Implementation**Start design\/code implementation\n\n**Week 7: Beta Test**\n\nGet feedback\n\n**Week 8: Deliver product, Survey Community**\n\nDeliver product if completed \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to project website: [https:\/\/www.fcgl.io\/](https:\/\/www.fcgl.io\/)",

Poetry looked promising, but it's still a wrapper to simplify managing virtual environments and not an actual SOLUTION to this issue.  I then found out about [PEP 582](https:\/\/www.python.org\/dev\/peps\/pep-0582\/) which was exactly what I was looking for and found about [pythonloc](https:\/\/github.com\/cs01\/pythonloc) which takes a NPM approach and wondered how the hell is this not more discussed?\n\nI'd like to hear r\/Python thoughts about my concerns, I really want to like Python, but before starting a new project the tooling turns me right off.",

   "description":"I'm going to community college right now and about done with my first year working towards my bachelors in psychology. I've been thinking real hard about my future and looking at the schooling needed in psychology before I can really start working in the field. I dont want to do it. I can't see myself being a therapist and having a bachelors in psych won't cut it for the field. I already switched my major from computer networking to psych during my first term because that major wasn't a transfer degree, it was an applied degree meant for those looking to work after their associate's. \n\nMy  community college offers a transfer degree in computer science and I've been thinking about switching majors to that. I'm not too far along in my degree right now, so most if not all of my classes so far would transfer over and I would just take different classes in the future. I love computers and I took an intro to computer science class in high school two years ago and liked it. It was hard but i was able to figure everything out and i loved the way I had to think in order to complete projects.\n\nI would have already switched but the only thing holding me back is, of course, math. When I took my colleges placement test, I was placed into math 10 which is one class above adult basic skills. This is the very beginning of the math sequence. I already completed math 10 and would be at math 20 leaving about 8 or 9 math classes before I get my associate's and am at calculus level math. This means at least 3 years at my community college before I can transfer to a 4 year with junior standing.\n\nWould you say this is worth the switch? I'm willing to put in the work and I dont hate math, I just had no idea of what I was doing in high school which led me to falling behind and not taking a math class my senior year. I really like psychology and learning about people, but I think I have more of a future in computer science, especially since I'm thinking about going into the FBI. There's also a lot of local software companies I'd be able to and love to work at.\n\nHave any of you been in the same situation? How'd it go?\n\nTl;dr\nThinking about switching majors to comp sci but I would have to complete 8 or 9 math classes before being at calc level due to poor placement test scores. Been working towards BA in psych but not seeing a future in It for me. Would this switch be worth it?",

   "description":"Hi I'm 16 years old, i'm studying programming at a school called STEP Computer Academy. We've been studying c for about 6 months and c++ for about 2 months. But i'm getting very overwhelmed by c and c++ in general. When i'm home i can'think of a program to write because I  don't know enough to write one. I can't do the homework they assign me .I thought this maybe not that important but then i saw how important c++ is. I'm really worried. Does this mean that i'm not fit for the roll of software engineer? I wanted to know your guys's opinion. Also i really do find the whole technology field fascinating especially he programs and machine learning algorithms.  \n\nThank you to everybody who took time out of their day to reply. I feel so uplifted and motivated. Thank you very much :)",

   "community_name":"Python",
   "url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Python\/comments\/4hazs4\/how_i_built_an_entire_game_and_toolchain_100_in\/",
   "description":"Hey everyone, I'm a C\/C++ programmer who recently discovered Python.  My friend told me about PyGame, and I decided to try to write an entire game in it.  I want to tell you the order I did things in, as I think you might find it interesting, and maybe try it yourself some time!\n\n**Background:**\n\nEpikos is an RPG I'd been wanting to make for years, but never really had the time to make.  Python, however, writes really expressive code and can really accelerate dev time.  I feel like I can write code 50X faster in Python than in C++.\n\nSince I have a day job, this had to be a project which I could do after work.  Entire thing took about two years, including making all the assets for the game and all the tools.  Workload was about 2 hours after work each day, and a lot more time on the weekends.\n\n**Step 1:  Making the tools for the game**\n\nFor reference, game screenshots can be seen here:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.epikosrpg.com\/screenshots\/\n\n**The Console:**\n\nFirst, I made what I call a \"console.\"  It's a bit like a DOS or Linux shell.  I wanted this so I could type commands into my game and the toolset used to create the game.  It doesn't look like much, but here is an example of what the console looks like:\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/mMutYwL\n\n**The Paint Program:**\n\nNext, the game needed a program to create sprite art in.  I could have used photoshop, aesprite, or any number of paint programs, but I wanted to make my own custom sprite animation tool, and I wanted it in Python.  I had barely done any python coding at this point, but even then the paint tool took only a couple of days to write.  It's called tilemake, and it looks like this:\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/Qw4BMMc\n\nAs you can see, this paint tool uses the console, which I had built first.  In the above example, I have loaded the \"knight\" sprite, which is used for one of the main characters in the game.  The tool shows you multiple zoomed in versions of the sprite (\"mips\") and you can paint on any one of them, using the CGA color palette.  You can also animate the sprites in this very tool.\n\nI got a lot of milage out of this tool, as the game has 826 sprite frames in it, all made with this very paint program.\n\n**The Map Editor:**\n\nNow, my game needed 2D maps.  Since I had some art made with the paint program, it was time to arrange this art in the form of a map.  The map editor looks like this:\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/qLA9vYk\n\nThere are several components to this editor, but keep in mind I'm sticking 100% to Python.  In the main view, you can zoom and scroll about with the mouse, and paint using several different sized brushes.\n\nYou can see a column to the right which says \"natural\".  This shows all the sprites which are used in a natural environment.  There are other categories, such as indoors, dungeon, etc.  Categories were important, since I have many, many different sprites.\n\nFinally, on the bottom you can see our old friend, the console.\n\n**Step 2:  The Game Itself:**\n\nOnce you have the map editor, making a game isn't really that different, it just has gameplay logic.  Most of it is really simple, this includes combat logic, movement, etc.  I'm not going to go into the details of these since writing them in Python should be fairly trivial, but ask me if you want something explained in greater detail.  I will, however, go over some highlights and gotchas:\n\n**AStar (A*):**\n\nA* is a common AI algorithm used for pathing.  Implementing it in Python is pretty easy.  Python reads a lot like pseudocode, and A* can be found on wikipedia:\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A*_search_algorithm\n\nThat code isn't really very different from Python is it?  As an excercise, you can try pasting that into Python and see what you need to change.  Hint:  not much.  Shouldn't take you more than half an hour to get some good AI pathing going.\n\n**Save\/Load with Pickle:**\n\nI *love* pickle, and used it for save\/loading.  It's a standard Python module, so if you haven't used it yet you should check it out.  One gotcha was that saveing and loading maps was too expensive in pickle, so I compressed the maps first with basic dictionary encoding, and then used pickle on them.\n\nWhen writing save\/load, make sure to include version filtering or some mechanism so that if you change file formats later on, older files are automatically updated.  You don't want your players to lose progress just because you patched and changed savegame format!\n\n**Font?:**\n\nThere are several legal issues surrounding the use of fonts on a cross-platform title, and I really didn't want to bother with that.  I couldn't find a good free font which matched my art style, so I created my own font for my game.  If you can do this, I recommend it, because then you own it and can use it forever.\n\n**Music:**\n\nOne thing I didn't write from scratch was the music authoring software.  Audio isn't really my expertise, but I wanted NES sounding music.  I ended up using this:\n\nhttp:\/\/famitracker.com\/\n\nFamitracker is a fun way to write NES-sounding music, and indeed it actually writes to the nes file format.  Of course, PyGame can't play this, so I converted it to .ogg format.  Why .ogg?  I found that other supported formats tended to crash pygame, so I recommend that one.\n\n**Sound FX:**\n\nSimilarly, I wanted an old-school feeling for my sound FX.  Authoring these in famitracker didn't seem that efficient, but someone showed me a tool called bfxr:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.bfxr.net\/\n\nThis let me create all kinds of sounds for my game.  For more complicated sounds, I needed to fallback to famitracker, but 90% of the sounds were in bfxr.\n\n**Shipping the Game:**\n\nI couldn't ship raw .py files, so I used pyinstaller to turn my game into a single .exe file.  I had tried python2exe, but couldn't get it to work very well with pygame.  Maybe you can have better luck with python2exe, but I'd recommend pyinstaller.  PyInstaller uses another library called setupTools.  For some reason, my .exe wouldn't work with the latest version of setupTools (gave an error and immediately quit), so I had to do this:\n\npip install setuptools==19.2\n\nThat gives you the older version, which should work.\n\nThe last part of shipping is making the .exe and game assets into an installer.  For this I used something called NSIS.  Sadly, I can't recommend you use this at this point, since it was on Sourceforge and if you go there now you'll probably get viruses and malware (RIP Sourceforge).  If you happen to have an older version of NSIS, I recommend backing it up on your google drive, since re-downloading it is not an option.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile there were some gotchas, I didn't have too much trouble making a small-scale game 100% in Python, and it was a suitable project to do after work, even while working a full-time job.  \n\nHappy coding!\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThank you for the Reddit gold.  This has inspired me to share some other misc info with you now:\n\n*  One huge advantage of Python is that porting from Windows to Linux only took an afternoon.  I did it all on virtualbox running Mint.  In fact, setting up virtualbox to run Mint was harder than porting the game.  There were two gotchas.  First, if you're using time.clock() on windows, make sure to change it to time.time() on Linux.  Second, some of the backslashes in filenames needed to be changed to forward slashes.  That's it!!!\n\n*  If you are on Windows, I recommend trying the Python plug-in for Visual Studio.  I didn't actually use it while developing my game, but I think it would have helped from time to time.  It gives breakpoints, variable watch, and callstack info.\n\n\n\n",

   "description":"The kids in my high school are really smart, and are doing stuff like accessing my school accounts even though I change my password all the time. The kids being the very selfless and open people they are never tell reveal how they actually get that kind of knowledge. Are kids like that gifted, or am I just stupid? If it is the former, how do I learn to do the things that they can do?  \nP.S whenever I ask them, they just pull the typical circumlocution bs as say something vague like \"I read a bunch of stuff online, but I don't know where\". How do they just casually \"read stuff online\" and suddenly become experts on TLS handshakes?\n\nThanks Guys",

If everyone could contribute at least one or two items, it\u2019s sure to be a great time. \n\nWhile we eat, we\u2019ll be playing music (be sure to check out the collaborative Spotify playlist and add to it if you want), playing around in the ocean, taking tons of pics, and getting a few games going. \n\nWe\u2019ll end the night with the best way to end any bonfire, s\u2019mores!!!! \n\nIf you\u2019re coming through, please remember to bring a towel, chair, or blanket for yourself! \n\nAlso, feel free to wear your CSUF merch to rep your Titan pride! \n\nLastly, in order to get an idea of how many snacks and drinks we need to buy, please fill out the following google survey if you will be attending: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSevXVSc8WmJRPLO4zJslNtUCK9zIBue58VCRr-Y2tYbwmo4Tg\/viewform\n\nThis survey is also available in the \u201cannouncements\u201d channel. \n\nThat\u2019s about it, hit me up via PM or in the comments below if you\u2019ve got any questions!\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n\\-Carol :)",

So starting today, you can get **Python 201: Intermediate Python** free through [Gumroad](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/py201#) or [Leanpub](http:\/\/leanpub.com\/python201\/c\/201free). \n\nIf you go with Gumroad, then you will need to use the following offer code: **201free**. Note that if you want to receive updates to the book, you will want to create an account and add the book to your library. \n\nI currently support the following digital formats: **PDF**, **epub** and **mobi** \n\nYou might also want to check out my blog which has lots of fun Python tutorials and links to my other books: http:\/\/www.blog.pythonlibrary.org\/\n\n**Update 2016-10-17**: For those of you who like numbers, I thought I'd share a bit of statistics with you. The number of people who used the Leanpub link to download the book hit **18,037** while approx. **6670** people used the Gumroad coupon. I don't have a simple way of checking who used both sites, so assuming that no one did, the total number of new readers is **24,707**!\n\nThat's so awesome! Thanks so much for your interest. I hope you all enjoy the book!",

   "description":"Hey r\/Coronavirus. After two very long weeks, I'm back for another AMA. If you didn't see my last, I look after critically ill COVID patients in a UK centre. The last time we talked, there were around 20 patients admitted to critical care for COVID nationally. A week after that post, that number was over 200 confirmed (with at least as many suspected cases) across the country. In London, the number has been doubling every few days.\n\nI have a couple of days off, and I'm here to take questions on the current situation, the UK government response, or anything else you might want to talk about.\n\nLike before, I'm remaining anonymous as this allows me to answer questions freely and without association to my employer (and I'm also not keen on publicity or extra attention or getting in trouble with my hospital's media department).\n\nThanks, I look forwards to your questions.\n\nEDIT: GMT 1700. Thanks for the discussion. Sorry about the controversy - I realise my statement was provocative and slightly emotional - I've removed some provocative but irrelevant parts. I hasten to stress that I am apolitical. I'll be back to answer a few more later. For those of you who haven't read the paper under discussion where Italian data was finally taken into account, this article might be interesting:  [https:\/\/ftalphaville.ft.com\/2020\/03\/17\/1584439125000\/That-Imperial-coronavirus-report--in-detail-\/](https:\/\/ftalphaville.ft.com\/2020\/03\/17\/1584439125000\/That-Imperial-coronavirus-report--in-detail-\/)\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the questions. I really hope that we will not get to where Italy are, now that quarantine measures are being put into place, and now that hospitals are adding hundreds of critical care extra beds. Stay safe!",

   "description":"starting this January, I'll be finishing up the final semester at a university, where I'll obtain a B.S in Computer Science. Today I received an email stating that I just got accepted to a 12-week long IOS Mobile Development Bootcamp that will begin in February. The Bootcamp itself is free as the company receives sponsors from other tech companies, so there will be no financial cost to me at all for attending this bootcamp. I'm not denying the practical experience that I'll obtain from the bootcamp, but I was wondering if my time could be better allocated elsewhere (like preparing for job interviews\/applying for jobs). \n\nTo give some background on my position, on top of completing my final 12 units that I need in order to graduate, this bootcamp will likely eat away the majority of the free time that I'll have left during the spring semester, and at the moment I do not have a job lined up for me after I graduate. During my current  winter break I've been allocating my daily free time towards applying to other places, organizing meetings for the school club that I'm running, and completing a few personal projects. I've also been working as a Software Engineering intern for a small startup, that will **not** likely lead to a full-time position. I also have limited experiences in mobile development as most of my personal projects and practical experiences are focused on the full-stack development of web-based software applications. I did make a few small apps, and I had a blast workin on those projects, so I wouldn't mind progressing my skills in mobile development. I just wouldn't know how applicable swift would be in the job market, along with mobile-development in general. I am taking a mobile development course as one of my final required courses at my university, where the emphasis would be on cross-platform apps, through c#, so this experience may make me more well-rounded?\n\n  I'm at a position where I feel that I need to just focus on applying and preparing for interviews, and highlight the experiences that I had already completed. At the same time, this bootcamp may expose me to networking opportunities, amazing lectures, and cool projects that I can add onto my resume. Should I take the opportunity considering its free, or should I focus on job hunting until I land a position?\n\n&#x200B;",

I love it, but it\u2019s *such* a broad field, and I\u2019m not even sure where to begin, career-wise. \n\nI already know that I much prefer working with software over hardware, and I have some experience as a programmer (Python and Java). I also love working with computer graphics and design. Movie CGI also seems interesting! Let\u2019s just say that I love combining technology and creativity. :0\n\nWhat do people usually get as entry-level jobs? What kind of internship should I get? And does anyone have any career suggestions based on my interests?\n\nI\u2019d also like to hear about *your* career, even if it doesn\u2019t have to do with my interests. I\u2019m always looking for new fields to explore within Computer Science!\n\nThanks guys! :)",

I will be primarily editing my original post so make sure to follow along. This post was mainly to just bring upon attention upon a petition that I have created to further bring attention to our situation as students.\n\n[http:\/\/chng.it\/KkxZVK7jfv](http:\/\/chng.it\/KkxZVK7jfv)\n\nAs students, I believe we all deserve the fair treatment of paying for a service, like education and receiving a product that is worth our money. Why is it okay for us to pay for a service and receive anything less than a good product? At the end of the day, WE, the students are paying for our professor's salary through part of our tuition fees. We shouldn't be fearful of our situation, having to gamble on getting a proper professor that is capable of teaching. We should be the ones taking charge if we are unsatisfied with our situation. I had received information that once again, said professor, is teaching next semester, which is unacceptable given the details from the main post. \n\nI highly recommend you sharing these posts and the petition in order to bring awareness about our situation. With the amount of talk these posts have been receiving throughout campus, it is evident that the Department and professors are aware of their situation and are simply choosing to ignore it instead of resolving the situation.\n\nAgain, I thank you all for understanding our situation and I hope for the Department to truly take action for the better.",

   "description":"Hey all,\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm going to be graduating this upcoming spring. I am applying for a program and if accepted I'd be teaching english in Japan anywhere between 1 - 5 years. The main reason I am doing this is because I'm just kind of burned out at this point in life and I would like to do something different before I settle down in a tech company. I also want to try and use this program as a foot in the door into working in the game industry in Japan. My concentration is in games so it'd be cool to get the chance to work at Nintendo, Sony, Square Enix, etc....\n\n\u200b\n\nI'd like to know if anyone here was in a similar situation where maybe they didn't go into the tech industry right after college and if so how did you keep your skills fresh? One thing that comes to mind for my situation in particular is getting to know other CS majors participating in the program and possibly collaborating on projects. There are definitely other CS people I have met online who want to  participate in the program while they are young and have nothing tying them down.\n\nObviously nothing is set in stone and a lot of things are still in the air but it's just something that I've been thinking about lately and I'd appreciate other people's insight",

   "description":"I recently checked out the Python exercises from CodingBat and I think they are horrible. The exercises are targeted at beginners and so I think they should teach people the pythonic way of doing stuff. I'm no expert in Python at all but even I found so many things that are just not the way it should be done. I feel like they transferred the Java solutions to Python. To give you some examples what I mean:\n\n * worst thing first: They override the  str name space, by supplying str as an argument in functions or assigning some string to it.\n\n * Java wording: they constantly refer to lists as arrays\n\n * Non Pythonic solutions: when accessing the last element of a list they write array[len(o)-1], instead of array[-1]\n\n\nEdit: Spelling \/ Format",

   "description":"I've been doing moocs since 2012. I went bonkers and spent 1 year doing  some 40+ courses from edX, coursera and udacity back then. Initial course offerings on these platforms were very (very) good and comprehensive. They also served well to kickstart mooc revolution.\n\nHowever It's been 8 years since then and I'm yet to see a good full blown course on Compilers, Language Theory (Automata) and Operating System. In my experience, Compilers by Alex Aiken (coursera -> stanford languita -> edx) is the only formidable course on the subject. CS262 by Westley weimer on Udacity was one of my favorites back in 2012, but it's shallow and introductory. I don't know why this is so. Even the compiler course (By Aiken) hasn't aged well. The toolkit for programming assignment (which is 80% of learning) is outdated and very difficult to work with.\n\nThere's a similar argument for Automata  and Operating Systems. There is a course by Ullman on Automata but it's not very comprehensible (no offense to Sir Ullman). Similarly, there are a few courses on OS on Udacity, but they aren't very comprehensive either.\n\nIn my experience, MIT has some of the best, most informative and comprehensive CS courses (on edX). Most of these courses have a detailed lab component and aren't water downed like others. We need a few such courses on the subjects like OS, Compilers and Language Theory. Courses with in-depth but easy to setup programming challenges that span for at least 10 weeks and cover the topic comprehensively.",

It was quite a lot to learn (and failing at the beginning), since my background is less programming and more mechanical engineering. But it was quite fun to figure everything out and grow with it. Here is the link:\n\n[https:\/\/github.com\/AndreWohnsland\/Cocktailmaker\\_AW](https:\/\/github.com\/AndreWohnsland\/Cocktailmaker_AW) \n\nAnd some pictures (also in the Github readme):\n\n[Machine and preparing a Cocktail](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Z4tfISx), [pictures of the UI](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/fbZ0WuS) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow i am looking forward to learn more and more Python. Currently I am working a lot with Pandas and Matplotlib at my job as a scientific researcher in the renewable energies sector. For the long therm, I want to get a job in Programming (preferably Python). Can anyone recommend what are good next steps to learn\/or improve? Currently I am reading and doing a lot of intermediate general Python Books\/exercises to improve my overall knowledge of the language and Programming but I don't know if this is the best next step. Any advice would be highly appreciated.\n\nHave a nice day :)",

Im a high school student going to college and i wanted to go into computer science as it seems VERY interesting and probably my best choice as a program but my guidance counselor tells me that i don\u2019t have the typical attitude a programmer has such as introverted and geekiness ( her legit words). Im usually social and i talk a lot and i\u2019m pretty hyper but when i have a task i concentrate on it till the end.\nSo, to all the programmers out there, is she right? Should i change?",

   "community_name":"csuf",
   "url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csuf\/comments\/2edmmr\/tips_for_freshman_from_a_csuf_grad_these_tips_can\/",
   "description":"I wanted to give you guys some tips because there were so many things that I wish I had known during my freshman year. I have been looking at posts on here lately, and I never knew that you can take the bus for free by using your titan card. That would have been so useful to know. Feel free to give your own tips down below. \n\n1) At CSUF, [only 17% of students graduate within four years and only 53% graduate within six years.](http:\/\/www.fullerton.edu\/analyticalstudies\/degrees_grad\/graduation_FTF.html) The sad truth is that most students don't study as much as they need to because they don't know how to study or make that transition from studying 3 hours to 20 hours a week. Many people flunk out of college or drop out because they didn't do any research about careers and they have no idea what to major in. Your school will have free resources to help you get the grades and research careers. Your school will offer free tutoring, you can visit your professors during their office hours and ask them for advice about how to study or you can ask them specific questions if you are confused about what you are learning, your school will have a [Learning Center](http:\/\/www.fullerton.edu\/ulc\/) with free handouts and workshops that will give you tips on how to study, they will have a [Writing Center](http:\/\/english.fullerton.edu\/writing_center\/) where someone will go over your essays with you and give you tips on how to improve your papers. Your school will also have a [Career Center](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CSUFcareer) where you can meet with Career Counselors, attend workshops, they will look over your resume and cover letters and give you tips, they will have career fairs, they will have local job and internship postings. You can ask Career Counselors any questions that you may have. See Career Counselors a few times a year. \n\n2) If you want to get a 3.5, then you probably have to plan on being in class for about 15 hours a week and studying around 20+ hours a week. That is only 35 hours a week and is less than a full time job. If you need to study more than 20 hours, then adjust your schedule if you happen to get too many B's after your first tests. Sure, some people only need to study 15 hours a week but most people need to study more than that. You also may want to watch study advice videos on Youtube. Look up: \"how to get straight A's\", \"how to study\", \"how to take notes in college\", \"how to get good grades in college\" etc. It would also be a good idea to read articles about how to do well in school. During my last two years of school, I almost always studied over 25 hours a week to get the grades I wanted. \n\n3) I once watched a Zach Braff movie that mentioned that your grades in college don't matter - that is not true. Your grades matter very much because you want grad school to be an option for you. You are young, and you are not sure what you want right now. Later on you may figure out you want a career that requires you to attend grad school. Many Postgraduate programs will want you to have a 3.5 or above. \n\nHere are some examples of the average GPA's that are accepted for a few Postgraduate education programs:\n\n* [3.52](http:\/\/www.apta.org\/ProspectiveStudents\/Admissions\/PTProcess\/) is the average accepted GPA for Physical Therapy programs \n* [3.8](http:\/\/slhs.sdsu.edu\/programs\/ma\/admission-requirements\/) is the average accepted GPA for SDSU's Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences MA program\n* [3.3](http:\/\/publichealth.sdsu.edu\/programs\/graduate\/mph\/environmental-health\/admissions\/) is the average accepted GPA for SDSU's Public Health program\n \n4) See your professors during their office hours. I was very lucky to receive this advice from one of my professors on my very first day of college. He told us that your professors like when students come in to ask questions, that you should always make sure your professors know your name, and you should make sure to stop by and see all of your professors during their office hours even if it is just to introduce yourself and say \"hello.\" I saw over 80% of my teachers during their office hours. It paid off tremendously. I got some great help and advice from them over the years, I sort of became friends with a couple of them, and I also received really great recommendation letters from them in case I decide to pursue grad school. \n\n5) Read the news. The news will discuss what careers will be in demand in the future. You can pick majors, join clubs, and get internships based on careers that will actually be in demand. \n\n6) Make sure to thoroughly research majors and careers before your sophomore year even starts. I'd say spend at least 30-40 hours researching careers before your sophomore year starts. \n\n7) Join clubs. I wanted to learn about social media, so I joined the [PRSSA](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/csufprssa). I was not a PR or Communications major. You can join any student organization you want, it doesn't matter what your major is. Joining the club was invaluable to me and it was the best decision I probably made while I was in college. \n\n* They have speakers that come in, who work in that particular field, and talk about their current job and past jobs, they give advice to students about how to prepare for life after graduation, they sometimes offer internships to the students in the clubs, they let you ask questions about their field. Hearing different people speak about different jobs and companies in the field that you want to work in helps you narrow down exactly what you want to do and what companies you want to work for. You are more prepared to go off on your own and understand the real world. \n* Clubs offer a lot of networking opportunities. My association hosted larger networking opportunities as well as some smaller networking opportunities as well. My favorite thing I did was go on a company tour to a tech company in Irvine and I got to ask the Social Media Director a ton of questions and I really picked her brain and I added her on LinkedIn. \n\n* My club actually had a member who went searching for internship postings for us, which was great because applying to internships isn't as stressful when everything is organized for you. \n\n* You get to chat with people who are interested in the same things you are and you can make friends.\n\n8) Get internships. I think the only reason I have a job right now is because I had three internships while I was in college. \n\n9) Be nice, friendly, and charming. I have had my grades pushed up because I often participated in class and my professors liked me. \n\n10) Don't be afraid to go to community college. CSUF is so expensive. It's pretty stupid to go there if you don't receive any grants or scholarships. Spend you first two years, or three, at a community college. You will pay about $2,500 for parking passes because most people graduate after five years. I think parking passes are about $50-$100 a year at community colleges. Ugh, everything is so much cheaper at a CCC. \n\n**Extra Tips:**\n\n1)There is a computer lab in the basement of McCarthy Hall that many students seem to not know about\n\n2)There is a Trader Joe's off Imperial Hwy. You can get really tasty and cheap salads and sandwiches there. I also like their snack selection and I think their sushi is really good too. \n\n3) Like [CSUF on facebook](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CSUFofficial) to learn about helpful and free workshops, free food, interesting opportunities etc. \n\n4) Don't be afraid to hang out with new people and try new things. Say \"yes\" to almost everything. \n\n5) Be nice. Offer to let people copy your notes. Buy an extra scantron in case someone forgets theirs. \n\n6) Use Google Drive to take notes and write papers. That way, you don't ever have to use flash drives. I have never owned a flash drive. Google Docs is just so convenient. \n\n\nSorry for my grammar mistakes. I wrote this pretty quickly. Feel free to ask any questions or let me know if you want me to elaborate on anything. \n\nHere is a [Guide for Freshman](http:\/\/www.oswego.edu\/academics\/opportunities\/honors\/program\/dowell.html) from SUNY Oswego. I think it is a very accurate and helpful guide.  \n\nEdit: Spelling and general editing. Again, I apologize for any grammatical errors that I have made. \n",

   "description":"It\u2019s going to take me 4.5 years to graduate but after completing my third year I still feel like I barely have any knowledge of computer science or programming. Whenever I read articles on a relevant topic or discussions on reddit the majority is completely foreign to me. \n\nI can write basic code in C++ and python and have pretty good knowledge of some data structures and sorting methods, but I feel like that\u2019s all I know. \n\nIs the majority of stuff learned later or am I just not in the right major? I just feel like I know so little compared to everyone else despite getting good grades. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for the comments and advice. Maybe I\u2019m not as bad off as I thought I was. I\u2019m going to put some more effort into personal projects than I\u2019ve been and hopefully I\u2019ll end up okay. ",

   "description":"So I recently applied to Amazon's 2020 Software Developer Internship program, however I was rejected at the first stage (didn't even qualify for technical interview).\n\nThe reason why I am posting this is because I applied the previous year, with less experience and worse grades and I managed to score a technical interview, which I then didn't get past.\n\nI apply again this year, with one internship under my belt from another company and a better GPA, but this time I didn't even qualify for a technical interview?\n\nI am not sure the reasoning behind this as I am now in my final year of university (which is a preference for this program), I have more experience, a better constructed CV and better grades. I'm not sure if Amazon does a darts approach to selecting applicants, but I just don't understand how I don't even qualify for the technical round.\n\nI'm not trying to bitch or complain that I didn't get in, it's just that I am far more qualified and arguably a better candidate than I was the first time round yet I don't even get a chance to prove myself AND I applied early.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this, is there a reasoning behind this? I don't think this has to do with Covid-19, since they did not explicitly state this in their email (plus why would they even advertise the position).\n\nIt's frustrating because I've worked hard to to get an internship at Amazon, yet my friend just applied willy nilly and passed all the interviews last year and scored an internship, when I know he isn't as qualified as I am now.",

An interesting experience where I learned a lot about the value of inheritance!\n\nWith this project I wanted to create a tool that is able to deliver me an overview of many different ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) without having to browse for hours to properly understand the difference between a large group of ETFs all targeted to track (for example) 'developing markets'.\n\nThis turned into the project '[The Passive Investor](https:\/\/github.com\/JerBouma\/ThePassiveInvestor)' which I am happy to share here.\n\nI created my first release ever with his project and I am very curious if it actually works properly on different machines (I know that Windows currently sees it as 'Not Safe' but it is no more than a generation of an .exe with pyinstaller. Looking into how to fix that). I did excessive testing and it all seemed to work just fine (for me). Not so happy about the file size though! *Would love to have some feedback about it and my code in general.*\n\nI hope I can also help someone with this program other than myself!",

So travelling outside the country isn't an option not to mention that being from an unstable country will make it harder for you to get a visa. \n\nprogramming has always been my passion, i code and learn for almost 8 hours a day, \\*\\*i don't want to do anything else\\*\\*, i don't know what i am going to do when i graduate i have no idea how to get a job in this place or how to get one remotely. \n\ni want to be a web developer ( full stack ) i just started learning JavaScript about 7 months ago it's been a blast !! but still extremely difficult, there are so many things to know i don't know how people remember this stuff but i hope i catch up.\n\nThanks a lot for reading.",

   "description":"Hey guys, was a bit distracted by the fact that Spotify Free is killing the mood sometimes in a foreign language, so decided to create a script that mutes all the sound whenever there is an ad playing. \n\nThis script only works on Windows.\n\nThis script get windll libraries and uses them to create a process name list (mostly copied code). \n\nAfter the list is built, it is checked for Process names \"Advertisement\" and \"Spotify\" to see if an ad is playing. These names are specific to the moment when ad is being played in Spotify. \n\nThe script is run in an interval, and does not fetch data real-time, so has small delays in runtime. As it is short and easily processed, does not load up CPU and doesn't leak memory.\n\nThe code: (Requires ctypes and pycaw libraries)\n\n\n    import ctypes #process find\n    import time   #sleep\n    from pycaw.pycaw import AudioUtilities #mute\n    \n    \n    while True:\n        EnumWindows = ctypes.windll.user32.EnumWindows    \n        EnumWindowsProc = ctypes.WINFUNCTYPE(ctypes.c_bool, ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int), ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int))\n        GetWindowText = ctypes.windll.user32.GetWindowTextW\n        GetWindowTextLength = ctypes.windll.user32.GetWindowTextLengthW\n        IsWindowVisible = ctypes.windll.user32.IsWindowVisible\n        ####### Modules to gather data\n        time.sleep(5)      #Sleep between checks (in seconds)\n        titles = [] #Empty list for titles (As String Objects)\n        def foreach_window(hwnd, lParam):\n            if IsWindowVisible(hwnd):\n                length = GetWindowTextLength(hwnd)\n                buff = ctypes.create_unicode_buffer(length + 1)\n                GetWindowText(hwnd, buff, length + 1)\n                titles.append(buff.value)\n            return True\n        EnumWindows(EnumWindowsProc(foreach_window), 0)\n        if \"Advertisement\" in titles:  #Spotify app is named as Advertisement\n            sessions = AudioUtilities.GetAllSessions()\n            for session in sessions:\n                volume = session.SimpleAudioVolume\n                volume.SetMute(1, None)\n        elif \"Spotify\" in titles:      #App named as Spotify(Only when ad plays, else it's Spotify Free)\n            sessions = AudioUtilities.GetAllSessions()\n            for session in sessions:\n                volume = session.SimpleAudioVolume\n                volume.SetMute(1, None)\n        else:\n            sessions = AudioUtilities.GetAllSessions()\n            for session in sessions:\n                volume = session.SimpleAudioVolume\n                volume.SetMute(0, None)\n        \n\n\nI am really interested in feedback on some places, as I believe I'm doing some actions too much, and would want to shorten it. It also mutes all processes at the moment, but I can't get to seem it to work a specific one yet (will try, but some help would be appreciated)).\n\nIf you also don't way to pay for spotify and mute sounds when app ads are running - feel free to use.",

   "description":"Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com\/sentdex](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/sentdex). \n\nI do my best to produce tutorials for beginner-intermediate programmers, mainly by making sure nothing is left to abstraction and hand waving. \n\nThe most recent series is an in-depth machine learning course, aimed at breaking down the complex ML concepts that are typically just \"done for you\" in a hand-wavy fashion with packages and modules. \n\nThe machine learning series is aimed at just about anyone with a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn. If you're confused about something we're doing, I can either help, or point you towards a tutorial that I've done already (I have about 1,000) to help.\n\nThe main structure for the course is to:\n\n* Do a quick overview of the theory of each machine learning algorithm we cover.\n* Show an application of that algorithm using a module, like scikit-learn, along with some real world data.\n* Break down the algorithm and re-write it ourselves, **without machine learning modules**, in Python.\n\nWe're not rewriting the algorithms with the intention that we're going to actually produce something superior than what's available, but rather to learn more about how the algorithms actually work, so that we understand them better. I also see a lot of people are very keen to learn about deep-learning, but the learning curve to get to that point is quite challenging, since quite a bit of deep learning requires you to have a wholistic understanding of how things are actually working, and not just a high-level understanding of how to use a module. Hopefully this can help. \n\nAt least for me personally, I have learned a lot by breaking the algorithms down, so I thought I would share that in my tutorials.\n\nAll tutorials are posted on **[PythonProgramming.net](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction\/)** as well as **[YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)**, so you can follow along in video, text, or both forms, and the content is all free. \n\nWe've done linear regression and K Nearest Neighbors so far, and have quite a long way to go still. We are going to be diving into the Support Vector Machine next, then clustering, neural networks and deep learning. Once we've made our way to deep learning, we're going to be working with TensorFlow.\n\nIf all that sounds interesting to you, come hang out and learn with us! \n\nI tend to release a couple videos a week. If you have suggestions\/requests, feel free to share. \n\nFollow along with the text\/video tutorials: on **[PythonProgramming.net](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction\/)** or **[YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)** ",

   "description":"Hi guys,\n\nYou might like a long-term project I try to build. It is a\ndatavisualization that aims to cluster movie posters and propose the ''closest'' movie\nposter.\n\nThe project is divided into two part:\n\n* [a search engine](https:\/\/movies.iwoaf.com\/index_complete.html) that allows you to find\n  the closest posters of a particular movie (have fun with the random button)..\n* [a scatter plot](https:\/\/movies.iwoaf.com\/) representing 1500 randomly picked movie posters into a 2D spaces.\n\nDon't forget that, for both of the webpages, you can click on any movie poster to get its closest posters.\n\n\n**General idea:**\n\nI thought you'd be interested in a little experiment with the ConvNets. I gain interest in\ndeep-learning 2 years ago and quickly wanted to exploit the power of Deep Convolutional\nNeural Network.\n\nBut first, one can estimate the ''distance'' between two images by subtracting the value for each\npixels and compute some sort of euclidean distance... However it will failed most of the\ntime (as for example if you slightly shift an image the distance with itself can be huge\n!!!). So ''close'' images can be translate as ''similar'' shapes\/motifs\/textures included\nin both of the images. There is of course a lot of more effective solutions such as\n[pHash](http:\/\/www.phash.org\/) or image-maching based on Fourier transform but I'd doubt\nit will give satisfying results for a relatively small movie posters database.\n\nThis is where the power of deep learning occur as it is normally able to learn\n[**invariant\nfeatures**](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-is-a-convolutional-neural-network-able-to-learn-invariant-features). The\nidea is to use ConvNet as features extractor that will map images into fixed meaningful\nsize vectors in which we will be able to use to compute distances between each others.\n\nSo basically, you take the output of a pre-trained ConvNet for all the images and then\ncompute distances between each images.\n\nI will not bother you more with the details as I wrote a [blog post](http:\/\/iwoaf.com\/finding-similar-movie-posters-with-convnet-deep-learning\/) about it. (it might no\nlonger be exactly what I did but It was written 2 years ago).\n\n**Cherry Picking:**\n\nAll those words to give you some cherry peak example of what the algorithm consider to be\nsimilar:\n\n* [Truman (2015)](http:\/\/iwoaf.com\/content\/images\/2017\/04\/17442_500.jpg)\n* [Looking for Kitty (2004)](http:\/\/iwoaf.com\/content\/images\/2017\/04\/19131_500-1.jpg)\n* [The Founders (2016)](http:\/\/iwoaf.com\/content\/images\/2017\/04\/36673_500.jpg)\n* [The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\n  (2008)](http:\/\/iwoaf.com\/content\/images\/2017\/04\/21649_500.jpg)\n* [Rock'n'Roll High School (1979)](http:\/\/iwoaf.com\/content\/images\/2017\/04\/7135_500.jpg)\n\n**Sofware\/Library used:**\n\nMost of the project is based on python:\n\n* data processing: [keras](https:\/\/keras.io\/), [sklearn](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/), [Pillow](https:\/\/pillow.readthedocs.io\/en\/5.3.x\/), [numpy](http:\/\/www.numpy.org\/)\n* backend: [flask](http:\/\/flask.pocoo.org\/), flask-restful\n* frontend: html, css, [d3js](https:\/\/d3js.org\/), javascript is a pain guys!\n* data-storage: Postgresql\n\nBy the way the data processing needs a relatively powerful computer (~32Go of RAM and a GPU\nfor the ConvNet part).\n\nThe datavisualizations are hosted on a VPS from [scaleway](https:\/\/scaleway.com).\n\n**The code:**\n\nThe code is available on [github](https:\/\/github.com\/adrz\/movie-posters-convnet) feel free\nto use it, criticize it. The code is probably not fully functional but I constantly pushed\naway its promotion because of my insecurity with it.",

   "description":"DON\u2019T show up a reasonable two hours early before class. You\u2019ll be an idiot like me and line up near the elevators at Nutwood. You\u2019ll find that there\u2019s an extremely low person exiting the structure to time spent waiting ratio. As you see an hour has passed, you\u2019ll get out of the line and head to lots A&G because the CSUF website says 1460 spots are \u201cavailable\u201d and you figure what\u2019s there to lose? Turns out parking lot is FULL. You\u2019ll see that there\u2019s Lot A South parking and want to test your luck there. As you pull in, There will be a line, so you wishfully hope that assisted parking is in effect since other cars or there too!!! WRONG. The lot is fucking closed. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Every car in line has to make a loop through the lot to exit. Manically go back to Nutwood. Class is now less than an hour away. You\u2019ll just about start to cry but hold it in since you don\u2019t want to look like a hot mess already during the first week of school when you walk into class late. \n\n\nDO: Fucking book it to CSUF parking at 2AM!!!! Hopefully there\u2019ll be one tiny spot for your fucking car!!!!!! I found luck coming to campus at 1:35AM and sleeping in my trunk for my morning class!!! Honestly, parking gets SOOOOO much better after the first few weeks. You\u2019ll only need to show up around 3:15AM during mid September to get a spot!!! The $285 permit you spent on campus parking will be so worth! It\u2019s soooooo much more convenient! TITANS REACH FUCKING HIGHER YALLL\n\n\njust a little tip heheheh. hope you guys find luck too!!!",

   "description":"I am 21 year old man going into his fourth and final year of college. By next summer, I will have graduated with a BS in Computer Science. I enjoy the field and it's something I feel like I can do a lot with, I'm definitely interested in it.\n\nThe problem I run into is that I feel so inexperienced. My older brother studied com sci for seven years (retaking courses that he didn't do well) and he did a few projects over the years, but he couldn't find any work for a while and even now, he's under paid and at a job where, as he describes, he doesn't do a whole lot of coding. What I'm trying to get at is, I don't want to land a job like this. I'd like to shoot big and go for something like Google, but I'm fairly confident that that is currently out of my realm of possibility at the moment. \n\nI haven't done any real personal projects, nor have I interned anywhere (these are the two biggest things I hear that com sci majors need to do) so I fear that I will appear undesirable to any potential employers. I make great grades in my courses (received my AS with above a 3.5 gpa, currently have a 3.4 as I transferred to a university last year) but don't think this will be enough. \n\nMy questions here and basically a Tl;Dr:\nHow can I, as a senior in college with no experience in the field, become more desirable to future potential employers? \n\nWhat sorts of projects away from school projects do employers like to see? I've coded a few algorithms in regards to graph theory using python, though c++ is my native language.\n\nWhat are some must-know things every com sci person should know before going into an interview?\n\nWhat have you done in the past to \"set yourself apart\" from the competition?\n\nThese are just questions to get the ball rolling, feel free to add or just answer whatever you want.\n\nThanks.",

Leave the page over for 2 seconds more than you should have, and it's no longer useful. \n\nWhat makes me angry the most is that we pay so much to be at this school, they have so many resources, and so much money stored away, and they stinge on something like this which would actually make our experience easier.

   "description":"Presented my final project last night, which represented the culmination of my five plus year experience with higher education. Wanted to leave a couple thoughts here. for whatever it's worth.  \nI am graduating from CSUF at the tender age of 45; I decided to return to school more than twenty years after I graduated high school.  I did it for myself and my career, and I did it for my kids, two of whom are now college students.  It's taken me over 5 years to get my bachelor's while working full time, the last 4 years of which have me commuting to a job 2 hours away.  I don't say any of this for recognition or kudos.  I say this to you, presumably younger people, to offer this free advice, for what it's worth: Stay.  Finish.  Do not give up.  If you leave, you're not going back.  When pressure is high, and your classes are difficult, and you're not sure if you can do it?  You can.  You can do it.  \nOne other piece of advice, and again, I say this to people I imagine are probably half my age: Don't take any shit from anybody.  I can't tell you how many articles I have read in the last five years running down \"millennials\" as soft, spoiled, lazy or entitled.  That is bull shit.  Recognize that criticism for what it is.  The talk of an older generation desperately afraid of young people.  Bunch of old farts who started their adult lives banging on about sticking it to the man, but ended up tanking the job and housing market.  Ignore them.  \nI have been continually amazed by my classmates' work ethic and commitment to excellence.  I have spent the last five years in classrooms with young people, and I see a generation that works hard, and will now have to support these ingrates in their old age.  \nAnyways, sorry so long.  Good luck to all and kick ass, Titans.\n",

   "description":"Hi yall,\n\nHere's some helpful information about our school before school starts.\n\nFor those taking ENG101 or need help with writing business letters or writing, in general, we have a writing center on campus. Here's is the link to that.\n\n[http:\/\/english.fullerton.edu\/writing\\_center\/](http:\/\/english.fullerton.edu\/writing_center\/)\n\nAppointments with the tutor\n\n[https:\/\/fullerton.mywconline.com\/](https:\/\/fullerton.mywconline.com\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor people wanting to work, the TSU and the library is the way to go. The second floor of the TSU has sofas and tables for you to work on hw and etc. In addition a quick tip if you have a large group study then I recommend you to rent out the study rooms at the Pollak Library. The link will be below this.\n\nID card not required at all times at the room\n\n[https:\/\/titans.service-now.com\/library\/library\\_catalog.do](https:\/\/titans.service-now.com\/library\/library_catalog.do)\n\n2 ID cards required at the rooms all the time (Smart Rooms):\n\n[https:\/\/apps.fullerton.edu\/SGCReserve\/](https:\/\/apps.fullerton.edu\/SGCReserve\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those people wanting a quiet place to study, the 3rd floor of the Pollak Library is the way to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those people needing help on creating their resumes, I would definitely check out the career center. That can be located on this room **LH 208.** They offer a wide range of services from checking your resumes to preparing an interview. You can definitely count on them with anything relating to internships\/jobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those wanting a place to chill\/hangout, I highly recommend TSU Underground. They have bowling, arcades and etc. A quick tip is that Bowling is free usually during Finals week so if you want to Bowl for free then you have that opportunity. In addition, some clubs will have events like free bowling, so definitely take advantage of that if you want to Bowl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those wanting cheap foods around campus, well you have options like Baja Express, Ensenada's Surf N Turf Grill, In N Out, McDonald's, Pepe's, Curry Hut and other more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those wanting free refills, look no further to Carl Jr. The refills cost $1.08 so take advantage of that!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those people in a hurry to eat look no further to Grubhub! If you install the app and select our school you should be able to order food ahead of time instead of waiting in line as the lines do get huge during lunch and dinner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those wanting to park on the weekends, the parking lot is free. You can park anywhere for free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those wanting the best coffee in the town look no further than Philz Coffee. It 7-8min walk from the Nutwood Parking Structure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those wanting the best chicken, there is Raising Cane's 6.1 miles from school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing, that I want to mention before I end, is that the Library is open 24hrs the week prior to finals week. In addition, they will continue on until the last day of the Finals day. In addition, the TSU is opened 24 hours during the finals week.\n\nOther than,\n\nI wish you all a wonderful semester! Good luck in your classes! Go Titans!",

Now don't get me wrong, of course there are specific jobs I would love to have that would make a big positive impact on the world, but as an entry level developer those jobs really aren't possible just yet.

Prior to this I had no experience with coding and so I really had to work at it to improve my understanding of python.\n\nWhile I have enjoyed working with python, and have learned a lot about CS, my interest has grown dramatically. The problem for me is that I find myself missing foundational aspects of CS which make it difficult to read explanations in stackoverflow, or documentation on particular libraries.\n\nI am now hoping to pick up another language that may be a little more explicit in its implementation so that I can try to understand what I am doing most of time with python. My only complaint thus far has been that python feels incredibly implicit in how it operates (this could be solely due to my own ignorance)\n\nWith so many to choose from, I am looking for suggestions. It appears so far that the obvious choices would be java or c. Any suggestions?",

Most of the replies as can be expected involved making tasks at work easier etc, which don't really apply to someone like me who doesn't have an office job or anything similar.\n\nSo, what are some cool uses for python for maybe younger people or just people without office jobs in general? It would be fun to find a project to work on or something that I can use python for in my daily life but as far as I'm aware i can't really think of anything that I need automated.\n\nThanks!",

   "description":"I've grown a real liking to coding and i thoroughly enjoy it actually. But i'm skeptical about a CS degree. In your opinion do you think that being good in math is a crucial part in being a successful Comp Sci Student? I'm a programming hobbyist and I've been working on a small scale Android game for the past few months. I've taken a real enjoyment to coding and programming. I'm wanting to further my education in computer programming and potentially get a job in the video game industry as an entry level programmer upon finishing my degree. Through all the research I've done I've come to find that most Programmers for mid-level and AAA companies started there journey with a Comp Sci degree. I've always had an aptitude for computers but Math never was my strong suit. I was pretty much a D and C student in all my math classes throughout high school. I know that when it comes to coding and programming specifically that math is not a super huge part but I like the idea of the broad spectrum of jobs that comes with a Comp Sci degree. Most of the prereqs for a Comp Sci degree consist of Calculus, and Physics. I am passionate about becoming a game developer but I am also weary that I may be in over my head pursuing a Comp Sci degree when my skills in math are sub-par. Any advice or feedback would be appreciated.",

It's also the same case where I live, but luckily I can get by ignoring it and learning stuff on my own. For example, I was taking a theory of computation course last semester and my lecturer got so unbearable that I opted to take the entire course through a MOOC on YouTube. The guy behind the channel was Indian, but he was very good. This isn't always the case, as some others are stuck in their ways and adamant on 'sharing' their knowledge through memorization techniques.  \n\n\nSo I ask this, why does it feel like only Indians share CS material online?

   "description":"[Link to announcement here.](http:\/\/coronavirus.fullerton.edu\/messages\/announcement-credit-no-credit-grading\/)\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nWe are all currently facing extraordinary challenges with COVID-19; if not from the virus itself then from its many and long-reaching effects. To help address these challenges and to encourage our students to persist and complete their academic course work this semester, Cal State Fullerton will institute a temporary modification in our academic grading processes.\n\nCreated transparently and in collaboration with our ASI leaders, Academic Senate Executive Committee, Academic Senate, deans, faculty, staff, students, and administration, this modification will empower students with the\u00a0**option**\u00a0of moving any and\/or all of their Spring semester 2020 courses from a letter grade to Credit \/ No-Credit (CR\/NC). Further, unlike most CR\/NC selections, in this instance, students will be given this option\u00a0*after*\u00a0they learn their grade in the course, thereby allowing them to choose the grading option that best suits their situation\u2014either a letter grade or a CR\/NC.\n\nSpecifically, the plan for this change, which is for Spring 2020 courses only, is as follows:\n\n* All courses (undergraduate and graduate) will be available for the CR\/NC grading option on the following basis:\n   * Undergraduate CR\/NC grading:\u00a0 CR = A through C- grades; NC = D through F grades.\n   * Graduate courses CR\/NC grading: CR = A through B- grades; NC = C through F grades.\n* The deadline for students to select CR\/NC grading options will be extended to June 1, 2020.\n* Faculty members will submit students\u2019 letter grades by May 22 as they typically would.\n* The students will then have a 10-day period to review their grades and determine either to retain the assigned letter grade or to opt into the equivalent CR\/NC grade.\n* Should students want to opt into CR\/NC:\n   * There will be a video tutorial presented to the students showing them the step by step process for opting into the CR\/NC option.\n   * Students will login to their Student Center in Titan Online and access a new page where they can opt in for CR\/NC, course-by-course. They will answer questions pertaining to the implications of their decision and acknowledge their understanding before they can indicate their decision.\n   * Students will decide course by course whether to retain their letter grade or select the equivalent CR\/NC option.\n   * After a student has chosen the CR\/NC grading option for a course, they may change that decision up until the deadline of June 1, 2020.\n* At the end of the review period, June 1 at 11:59 p.m., grades will be finalized on transcripts, per the Office of the Registrar.\n* If a student does not opt into the CR\/NC grade for any particular course, the letter grade will serve as the default official grade.\n* We are also extending the deadline to withdraw from a class for non-medical reasons to May 8, 2020, the last day of classes. The Chancellor\u2019s Office has waived sections of EO 1037 for this semester, so that Spring 2020 withdrawals will not count towards the normal 18-unit limit on withdrawals.\n\nSince the benefits to these modifications will impact individuals differently,\n\n* the University will provide advising early and often to ensure students are equipped to make the grading choices that best serves their unique goals and needs.\u00a0\n* students with questions about Financial Aid impact should go to the Financial Aid website for a quick reference on CR\/NC.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n* [**FAQ document for students**](http:\/\/coronavirus.fullerton.edu\/credit-no-credit-grading-basis-for-csuf-students\/)\n* [**FAQ for faculty\/staff**](http:\/\/coronavirus.fullerton.edu\/credit-no-credit-grading-basis-for-faculty\/)\n\nWe know that these actions alone cannot relieve all the difficulties related to COVID-19, but we hope they will alleviate at least some of the academic-related stress. We have made these temporary changes with our central focus on informed student choice and flexibility. We are grateful for all that our faculty and staff are doing each day to continue instruction and all that our students are doing to continue learning under these challenging circumstances. Together and as Titans, we will persevere, we will overcome, and we will succeed.\u00a0\n\nIn so many ways, we already are.\n\nThank you, Titan Family.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFram Virjee  \nPresident\n\nPamella H. Oliver  \nProvost and Vice President for Academic Affairs",

To check the diagonals, I tilt the board by moving the nth row over by either n or -n. This function accomplishes that in basically one line of code, adding 0s for the filler spaces, and changing the direction it tilts in by setting d from 1 to -1. Thus, I can just do [[1], [1], [1], [1]] in shift(board) to check if player 1 has won by one diagonal, and [[1], [1], [1], [1]] in shift(board, -1) to check the other diagonal.",

   "description":"&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:**\n\nI just woke up and I read all your constructive feedback. WOW, this is why I love Reddit sometimes. I will try and implement all the tips and tricks to my app.\n\nQuick question (I woke up with this idea), if I wanted to add a dictionary to my app, to check if the word is a real word, is it easily achievable?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\nI am a High School dropout and I have no degree. I started working in IT about 8 years ago and made my way to being a System Administrator for a small Supermarket chain. I am new to Python and the only language I know a little of is Powershell.\n\n**Why I want to learn Python:**\n\nThere are not a lot of practical skills that I learned on my own. So on December 28th, I decided to put my energy into learning how to code. I saw a post in r\/powershell : [Powershell Guide to Python](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PowerShell\/comments\/ab27n2\/book_update_powershell_guide_to_python\/) by  [u\/Prateeksingh1590](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Prateeksingh1590) and decided I wanted to learn Python. So I watched 2.5 hours out of the 4 hours from [this video for beginners](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=12978s). I also watched 2 hours of a [Lynda.com](https:\/\/Lynda.com) course, mainly reviewing what I had learned from [Mike Dane](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).\n\n**The App:**\n\nAt one point, I wanted to know if I could code an app with the little basic knowledge I had. I thought about building an guessing word game. So I layed out want I wanted to achieve. I wanted the person guessing to have 3 information while guessing a word :\n\n1 - To know if the have more, less or equal the characters of the word\n\n2 - To know if they have some letters right\n\n3 - To if the letters that are right are in the right spot\n\n**Making the App:**\n\nSo I started my journey to make this app. It took me over a week and about 8-10 hours of trials and errors and googling to achieve the app. Watch out for yourself, it's pretty ugly. but it works.\n\n**Feedback is more than welcome**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    from getpass import getpass\n    \n    word = getpass(\"Enter the secret word :\")\n    word = (word.lower())\n    word_compare = set(word)\n    word_char = len(word)\n    word_len = word_char\n    guess_word = \"\"\n    not_eno = \"Not enough characters in your guess\"\n    too_many = \"Too many characters in your guess\"\n    exactly = \"You have the exact number of characters in your guess\"\n    ok_letters = 0\n    count = 0\n    \n    while guess_word != word:\n        count += 1\n        guess_word = input('What is the secret word?')\n        guess_word = (guess_word.lower())\n        guess_char = len(guess_word)\n        guess_len = guess_char\n        guess_compare = set(guess_word)\n        same_char = word_compare & guess_compare\n        num_same_char = len(same_char)\n        if guess_word == word:\n            break\n        elif len(guess_word) != 0:\n            if word_char > guess_char:\n                word_char = guess_char\n            elif guess_char > word_char:\n                dif = guess_char - word_char\n                word_char = guess_char\n                for add_letters in range(dif):\n                    word = word + str(add_letters)\n            for num_letters in range(word_char):\n                if guess_word[num_letters] == word[num_letters]:\n                    ok_letters = ok_letters + 1\n            if guess_len < word_len:\n                print(\"This is try # \" + str(count) + \". \\n\"\n                      + str(not_eno) + \". \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(num_same_char) + \" good letter(s). \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(ok_letters) + \" letter(s) correctly placed.\")\n            elif guess_len > word_len:\n                print(\"This is try # \" + str(count) + \". \\n\"\n                      + str(too_many) + \". \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(num_same_char) + \" good letter(s). \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(ok_letters) + \" letter(s) correctly placed.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"This is try # \" + str(count) + \". \\n\"\n                      + str(exactly) + \". \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(num_same_char) + \" good letter(s). \\n\"\n                      + \"You have \" + str(ok_letters) + \" letter(s) correctly placed.\"\n                      )\n            ok_letters = 0\n        else:\n            print(\"You have entered nothing, please try again\")\n    print(\"Congratulation!!!

   "description":"Hi, we recently updated an article on Python web frameworks at our company blog. I was wondering if there are any other frameworks you find useful that we missed and should add to the list. I\u2019m copying the entire list here (each entry also has some sample code, but I\u2019m excluding that). Please let me know if you think we should add any framework. \n\n(and, if you\u2019d like to check out the full article, you can find it here: [A Beginner\u2019s Introduction to Python Web Frameworks](https:\/\/stxnext.com\/blog\/2018\/09\/27\/beginners-introduction-python-frameworks\/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=2019-08-jd))\n\n## Django\n\n**The most popular Python framework is Django, hands down.** Django\u2019s trademark is that it offers all the tools you need to build a web application within a single package, from low- to high-end.\n\nDjango applications are based on a design pattern similar to MVC, the so-called MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern. Models are defined using the Django ORM, while SQL databases are mainly used as storage.\n\nDjango has a built-in admin panel, allowing for easy management of the database content. With minimal configuration, this panel is generated automatically based on the defined models.\n\nViews can include both functions and classes, and the assignment of URLs to views is done in one location (the urls.py file), so that after reviewing that single file you can learn which URLs are supported. Templates are created using a fairly simple Django Templates system.\n\nDjango is praised for strong community support and detailed documentation describing the functionality of the framework. This documentation coupled with getting a comprehensive environment after the installation makes the entry threshold rather low. Once you go through [the official tutorial](https:\/\/docs.djangoproject.com\/en\/1.11\/intro\/tutorial01\/), you\u2019ll be able to do most of the things required to build an application.\n\n**Unfortunately, Django\u2019s monolithism also has its drawbacks.** It is difficult, though not impossible, to replace one of the built-in elements with another implementation. For example, using some other ORM (like SQLAlchemy) requires abandoning or completely rebuilding such items as the admin panel, authorization, session handling, or generating forms.\n\nBecause Django is complete but inflexible, it is suitable for standard applications (i.e. the vast majority of software projects). However, if you need to implement some unconventional design, it leads to struggling with the framework, rather than pleasant programming.\n\n## Flask\n\nFlask is considered a microframework. It comes with basic functionality, while also allowing for easy expansion. Therefore, **Flask works more as the glue that allows you to join libraries with each other.**\n\nFor example, \u201cpure Flask\u201d does not provide support for any storage, yet there are many different implementations that you can install and use interchangeably for that purpose (such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-MongoAlchemy, and Flask-Redis). Similarly, the basic template system is Jinja2, but you can use a replacement (like Mako).\n\nThe motto of this framework is \u201cone drop at a time,\u201d and this is reflected in its comprehensive documentation. The knowledge of how to build an application is acquired in portions here; after reading a few paragraphs, you will be able to perform basic tasks.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know the more advanced stuff right away\u2014you\u2019ll learn it once you actually need it. Thanks to this, students of Flask can gather knowledge smoothly and avoid boredom, making Flask suitable for learning.\n\n**A large number of Flask extensions, unfortunately, are not supported as well as the framework itself.** It happens quite often that the plug-ins are no longer being developed or their documentation is outdated. In cases like these, you need to spend some time googling a replacement that offers similar functionality and is still actively supported.\n\nWhen building your application with packages from different authors, you might have to put quite a bit of sweat into integrating them with each other. You will rarely find ready-made instructions on how to do this in the plug-ins\u2019 documentation, but in such situations the Flask community and websites such as Stack Overflow should be of help.\n\n## Pyramid\n\nPyramid, the third noteworthy Python web framework, is rooted in two other products that are no longer developed: Pylons and repoze.bfg. **The legacy left by its predecessors caused Pyramid to evolve into a very mature and stable project.**\n\nThe philosophies of Pyramid and Django differ substantially, even though both were released in the same year (2005). Unlike Django, Pyramid is trivial to customize, allowing you to create features in ways that the authors of the framework themselves hadn\u2019t foreseen. It does not force the programmer to use framework\u2019s idioms; it\u2019s meant to be a solid scaffolding for complex or highly non-standard projects.\n\nPyramid strives to be persistence-agnostic. While there is no bundled database access module, a common practice is to combine Pyramid with the powerful, mature SQLAlchemy ORM. Of course, that\u2019s only the most popular way to go. Programmers are free to choose whatever practices suit them best, such as using the peewee ORM, writing raw SQL queries, or integrating with a NoSQL database, just to name a few.\n\nAll options are open, though this approach requires a bit of experience to smoothly add the desired persistence mechanisms to the project. The same goes for other components, such as templating.\n\nOpenness and freedom are what Pyramid is all about. Modules bundled with it relate to the web layer only and users are encouraged to freely pick third-party packages that will support other aspects of their projects.\n\n**However, this model causes a noticeable overhead at the beginning of any new project,**because you have to spend some time choosing and integrating the tools your team is comfortable with. Still, once you put the effort into making additional decisions during the early stages of the work, you are rewarded with a setup that makes it easy and comfortable to start a new project and develop it further.\n\nPyramid is a self-proclaimed \u201cstart small, finish big, stay finished framework.\u201d This makes it an appropriate tool for experienced developers who are not afraid of playing the long game and working extra hard in the beginning, without shipping a single feature within the first few days. Less experienced programmers may feel a bit intimidated.\n\n## web2py\n\nCreated in 2007, web2py is a framework originally designed as a teaching tool for students, so the main concern for its authors was ease of development and deployment.\n\nWeb2py is strongly inspired by Django and Ruby on Rails, sharing the idea of **convention over configuration. In other words, web2py provides many** ***sensible defaults*** **that allow developers to get off the ground quickly.**\n\nThis approach also means there are a lot of goodies bundled with web2py. You will find everything you\u2019d expect from a web framework in it, including a built-in server, HTML-generating helpers, forms, validators, and many more\u2014nothing unusual thus far, one could argue. Support for multiple database engines is neat, though it\u2019s a pretty common asset among current web frameworks.\n\nHowever, some other bundled features may surprise you, since they are not present in other frameworks:\n\n* helpers for creating [JavaScript](https:\/\/stxnext.com\/services\/javascript-development\/)\\-enabled sites with jQuery and Ajax;\n* scheduler and cron;\n* 2-factor authentication helpers;\n* text message sender;\n* an event-ticketing system, allowing for automatic assignment of problems that have occurred in the production environment to developers.\n\nThe framework proudly claims to be a full-stack solution, providing everything you could ever need.\n\nWeb2py has extensive documentation available online. It guides newcomers step by step, starting with a short introduction to the Python language. The introduction is seamlessly linked with the rest of the manual, demonstrating different aspects of web2py in a friendly manner, with lots of code snippets and screenshots.\n\n**Despite all its competitive advantages, web2py\u2019s community is significantly smaller than Django\u2019s, or even Pyramid\u2019s.** Fewer developers using it means your chances of getting help and support are lower. The official mailing list is mostly inactive.\n\nAdditionally\u2014and unfortunately\u2014web2py is not compatible with Python 3 at the moment. This state of things puts the framework\u2019s prospects into question, as support for Python 2 ends in 2020. This issue is being addressed on the project\u2019s github. [Here](https:\/\/github.com\/web2py\/web2py\/issues\/1353) is where you can track the progress.\n\n## Sanic\n\n**Sanic differs considerably from the aforementioned frameworks because unlike them, it is based on asyncio**\u2014Python\u2019s toolbox for asynchronous programming, bundled with the standard library starting from version 3.4.\n\nIn order to develop projects based on Sanic, you have to grasp the ideas behind asyncio first. This involves a lot of theoretical knowledge about coroutines, concurrent programming caveats, and careful reasoning about the data flow in the application.\n\nOnce you get your head around Sanic\/asyncio and applies the framework to an appropriate problem, the effort pays off. Sanic is especially useful when it comes to handling long-living connections, such as websockets. If your project requires support for websockets or making a lot of long-lasting external API calls, Sanic is a great choice.\n\nAnother use case of Sanic is writing a \u201cglue-web application\u201d that can serve as a mediator between two subsystems with incompatible APIs. Note that it requires at least Python 3.5, though.\n\nThe framework is meant to be very fast. One of its dependencies is [uvloop](https:\/\/github.com\/MagicStack\/uvloop)\u2014an alternative, drop-in replacement for asyncio\u2019s not-so-good built-in event loop. Uvloop is a wrapper around libuv, the same engine that powers Node.js. According to the uvloop documentation, this makes asyncio work 2\u20134 times faster.\n\n**In terms of \u201cwhat\u2019s in the box,\u201d Sanic doesn\u2019t offer as much as other frameworks.** It is a microframework, just like Flask. Apart from routing and other basic web-related goodies like utilities for handling cookies and streaming responses, there\u2019s not much inside. Sanic imitates Flask, for instance by sharing the concept of Blueprints\u2014tiny sub-applications that allow developers to split and organize their code in bigger applications.\n\nSanic also won\u2019t be a good choice for simple CRUD applications that only perform basic database operations. It would just make them more complicated with no visible benefit.\n\n## Japronto\n\nHave you ever imagined handling 1,000,000 requests per second with Python?\n\nIt seems unreal, since Python isn\u2019t the fastest programming language out there. But when a brilliant move was made to add asyncio to the standard library, it opened up countless possibilities.\n\nJapronto is a microframework that leverages some of them. As a result, **this Python framework was able to cross the magical barrier of 1 million requests handled per second.**\n\nYou may still be at a loss as to how that is possible, exactly.\n\nIt all comes down to 2 aces up Japronto\u2019s sleeve: uvloop and PicoHTTPParser. Uvloop is an asyncio backend based on libuv, while PicoHTTPParser is a lightweight HTTP headers parser written in C. All core components of the framework are also implemented in C. A wide variety of low-level optimizations and tricks are used to tweak performance.\n\nJapronto is designed for special tasks that could not be accomplished with bloated mainstream frameworks. It is a perfect fit for problems where every nanosecond counts. Knowledgeable developers, obsessed with optimization, will reap all of its possible benefits.\n\nAdditionally, Japronto is meant to provide a solid foundation for microservices using REST APIs with minimal overhead. In other words, there\u2019s not much in the box. Developers only need to set up routing and decide which routes should use synchronous or asynchronous handlers.\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but if a request can be handled in a synchronous way, you shouldn\u2019t try to do it asynchronously, as the overhead of switching between coroutines will limit performance.\n\n**What is quite unfortunate is that Japronto is not being actively developed.** On the other hand, the project is licensed under MIT, and the author claims he is willing to accept any contributions. Like Sanic, the framework is meant to work with Python 3.5+ versions.\n\n## aiohttp\n\nAiohttp is another library based on asyncio, the modern Python toolkit for writing asynchronous code. **Not meant to be a framework in a strict sense, aiohttp is more of a toolbox, supplementing the async arsenal with everything related to HTTP.**\n\nThis means aiohttp is helpful not only for writing server applications, but also to clients. Both will benefit from asyncio\u2019s goodies, most of all the ability to handle thousands of connections at the same time, provided the majority of operations involves I\/O calls.\n\nSuch powerful clients are great when you have to issue many API calls at once, for example for scraping web pages. Without asyncio, you would have to use threading or multiprocessing, which are harder to get right and require much more memory.\n\nApart from building standalone applications, aiohttp\u2019s clients are a great supplement to any asyncio-based application that needs to issue non-blocking HTTP calls. The same is true for websockets. Since they are part of the HTTP specification, you can connect to websocket servers and easily exchange messages with them.\n\nWhen it comes to servers, aiohttp gives you everything you can expect from a microframework. The features available out-of-the-box include routing, middleware, and signals. It may seem like it\u2019s very little, but it will suffice for a web server.\n\n\u201cWhat about the remaining functionalities?\u201d you may ask.\n\nAs far as those are concerned, you can build the rest of the functionalities using one or many asyncio-compatible libraries. You will find plenty of them using sources [like this one](https:\/\/github.com\/timofurrer\/awesome-asyncio).\n\nAiohttp is built with testing in mind. Developers who want to test an aiohttp-based application will find it extremely easy, especially with the aid of pytest.\n\nEven though aiohttp offers satisfactory performance by default, there are a few low-hanging fruits you can pick. For example, you can install additional libraries: cchardet and aiodns. Aiohttp will detect them automatically. You can also utilize the same uvloop that powers Sanic.\n\nLast but not least: **one definite advantage of aiohttp is that it is being actively maintained and developed.** Choosing aiohttp when you build your next application will certainly be a good call.\n\n## Twisted\n\nWith Twisted, Python developers were able to do async programming long before it was cool. Twisted is one of the oldest and most mature Python projects around.\n\nOriginally released in 2002, Twisted predates even PEP8, so the code of the project does not follow the famous code style guide recommendations. Admittedly, this may somewhat discourage people from using it these days.\n\nTwisted\u2019s heart is an event-driven networking engine called reactor. It is used for scheduling and calling user-defined callbacks.\n\nIn the beginning, developers had to use explicit callbacks by defining functions and passing them around separately for cases when an operation succeeded and when it failed.\n\nAlthough this technique was compelling, it could also lead to what we know from early JavaScript: callback hell. In other words, the resultant code was tough to read and analyze.\n\n**At some point, Twisted introduced inlineCallbacks\u2014the notation for writing asynchronous code that was as simple to read as regular, synchronous code.** This solution played very well with Python\u2019s syntax and greatly influenced modern async toolkit from the standard library, asyncio.\n\nThe greatest advantage of this framework is that although Twisted itself is just an engine with few bundled extensions, there are many additional extensions available to expand its functionality. They allow for both low-level network programming (TCP\/USP) and high, application-level work (HTTP, IMAP, SHH, etc).\n\n**This makes Twisted a perfect choice for writing specialized services; however, it is not a good candidate for regular web applications.** Developers would have to write a lot of things on their own to get the functionality they take for granted with Django.\n\nTwisted is being actively maintained. There is an undergoing effort to migrate all of its code to be compatible with Python 3. The core functionality was rewritten some time ago, but many third-party modules are still incompatible with newer versions of the interpreter.\n\nThis may raise some concerns whether Twisted is the best choice for new projects. On the other hand, though, it is more mature than some asyncio-based solutions. Also, Twisted has been around for quite some time now, which means it will undoubtedly be maintained at least for a good while.\n\n## Falcon\n\nFalcon is another microframework on our list. The goal of the Falcon project is to create a minimalist foundation for building web apps where the slightest overhead matters.\n\nAuthors of the framework claim it is a **bare-metal, bloat-free toolkit for building very fast backend code and microservices.** Plus, it is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.\n\nA big advantage of Falcon is that it is indeed very fast. Benchmarks published on its website show an incredible advantage over mainstream solutions like Django or Flask.\n\nThe downside, though, is that **Falcon offers very little to start with.** There\u2019s routing, middlewares, hooks\u2014and that\u2019s basically everything. There are no extras: no validation, no authentication, etc. It is up to the developer to extend functionality as needed.\n\nFalcon assumes it will be used for building REST APIs that talk JSON. If that is the case, you really need literally zero configuration. You can just sit down and code.\n\nThis microframework might be an exciting proposition for implementing highly-customized services that demand the highest performance possible. Falcon is an excellent choice when you don\u2019t want or can\u2019t invest in asyncio-based solutions.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cSometimes the simplest solution is the best one,\u201d you should definitely consider Falcon.\n\n## API Star\n\nAPI Star is the new kid on the block. It is yet another microframework, but this one is compatible with Python 3 only. Which is not surprising, because it leverages type hints introduced in Python 3.5.\n\n**API Star uses type hints as a notation for building validation schemata in a concise, declarative way.** Such a schema (called a \u201cType\u201d in the framework\u2019s terminology) can then be bound to request a handling function.\n\nAdditionally, API Star features automatically generated API docs. They are compatible with OpenAPI 3. Such docs can facilitate communication between API authors and its consumers, i.e. frontend developers. If you use the Types we\u2019ve mentioned, they are included in the API docs.\n\nAnother outstanding feature is the dependency injection mechanism. It appears to be an alternative to middlewares, but smarter and much more powerful.\n\nFor example, you can write a so-called Component that will provide our views with a currently authenticated User. On the view level, you have to explicitly state that it will require a User instance.\n\nThe rest happens behind the scenes. API Star resolves which Components have to be executed to finally run our view with all the required information.\n\nThe advantage that automatic dependency injection has over regular middlewares is that Components do not cause any overhead for the views where they are not used.\n\nLast but not least, API Star can also be run atop asyncio in a more traditional, synchronous, WSGI-compliant way. **This makes it probably the only popular framework in the Python world capable of doing that.**\n\nThe rest of the goodies bundled with API Star are pretty standard: optional support for templating with jinja2, routing, and event hooks.\n\nAll in all, API Star looks extremely promising. At the time of writing, it has over 4,500 stars in its GitHub repository. The repository already has a few dozen contributors, and pull requests are merged daily. Many of us at STX Next are keeping our fingers crossed for this project!\n\n## Other Python web development frameworks\n\nThere are many more Python web frameworks out there you might find interesting and useful. Each of them focuses on a different issue, was built for distinct tasks, or has a particular history.\n\nThe first that comes to mind is **Zope2,** one of the oldest frameworks, still used mainly as part of the Plone CMS. **Zope3** (later renamed BlueBream) was created as Zope2\u2019s successor. The framework was supposed to allow for easier creation of large applications, but hasn\u2019t won too much popularity, mainly because of the need to master fairly complex concepts (e.g. Zope Component Architecture) very early in the learning process.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the **Google App Engine,** which allows you to run applications written in Python, among others. This platform lets you create applications in any framework compatible with WSGI. The SDK for the App Engine includes a simple framework called webapp2, and this exact approach is often used in web applications adapted to this environment.\n\nAnother interesting example is **Tornado,** developed by FriendFeed and made available by Facebook. This framework includes libraries supporting asynchronicity, so you can build applications that support multiple simultaneous connections (like long polling or WebSocket).\n\nOther libraries similar to Tornado include **Pulsar** (async) and **Gevent** (greenlet). These libraries allow you to build any network applications (multiplayer games and chat rooms, for example). They also perform well at handling HTTP requests.\n\nDeveloping applications using these frameworks and libraries is more difficult and requires you to explore some harder-to-grasp concepts. We recommend getting to them later on, as you venture deeper into the wonderful world of Python.\n\n\\----------------\n\nThis is the full list we came up with.

   "url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/computerscience\/comments\/ewa5vv\/why_introduction_to_algorithms_ie_clrs_is_a_great\/",
   "description":"Hi guys,\n\nIf you search the book \"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Cormen, then you will find a lot of people saying that this book is not a good book for beginners.\n\nYou probably won't care, but I would like to say a bit about why I disagree.\n\nA beginner, to my mind, is someone who probably has not acquired patterns associated with imperative programming, e.g., nested loops, looping over arrays. In other words, not much experience programming with basic built in programming constructs. It could be someone who is coming from a functional programming language with no imperative programming experience.\n\nIf you understand the algorithms in CLRS and implement them in an imperative language, such as Python, then you will develop a library of models or chunks. These models or chunks, in turn, will help you solve future problems.\n\nSolving a problem you haven\u2019t seen before requires you to link existing chunks. So, the more chunks you acquire, the better problem solver you become.\n\nFrom a problem solving point of view a chunk can be seen as a solution. It can also be seen as a model.\n\nBy doing this you will become a better python programmer and since many imperative languages share the same programming constructs you will become a better programmer in general. In addition, you will learn how to analyze algorithms, which is part of the essence of programming. I read a research paper about what distinguishes great software engineers. One of the things these researchers learnt was that great software engineers pay attention to details; for example, they are attentive enough to implement efficient algorithms.\n\nSo, I think, if you have some mathematical sense, and you are willing to think hard, and lack imperative programming experience then I think CLRS is great book to study.",

   "description":"Over the past 20+ years, my family took tens of thousands of photos while visiting countries all around the world. As the years went by, the total number of stored images seems to grow every time we travel and even though we organize our images, sometimes it\u2019s hard to recall when (exactly which year and month) we visited a specific place. Thinking about it, I realized that nowadays most photos are captured on smartphones or digital cameras that come equipped with GPS and automatically geotag each photo with GPS coordinates, as well as date and time of each image capture.\n\nThat said, I wrote a Python GUI App (<300 lines of code) that you can point to a directory where your photos are stored and the script will do the rest. It'll scan and extract the Exif information from all your images and convert the gathered EXIF information into:\n\n* **Excel Travel Log** \\- List of locations sorted by month\/year\n* **Google Map** \\- This is a visual representation of all our travels. Google Map pins show the detail date and time of our visit\n\nFollowing are some screenshots from the **PythonPhoto2Location** app, outlining the four steps it takes to get from a collection of photos to an Excel file and Google Maps:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zg1n2du8xep31.jpg?width=1702&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=baa0789b03e57c77440c2b78037c583470034b1f\n\n**VIDEO DEMO:**\n\nHere is a 2-minute long Video outlining the app functionality:\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/JFZsFIZpiuw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/JFZsFIZpiuw)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SOURCE CODE:**\n\nApplication is released as an open-source on Github: [https:\/\/github.com\/JozefJarosciak\/PythonPhoto2Location](https:\/\/github.com\/JozefJarosciak\/PythonPhoto2Location)\n\nFeel free to fork the, make it better, or amend the script to your liking.\n\nSummary of the Photo2Location app on my blog: [https:\/\/www.joe0.com\/2019\/09\/28\/visualizing-jpeg-exif-using-python-how-to-convert-jpeg-meta-data-into-excel-travel-log-and-google-map-of-all-visited-places\/](https:\/\/www.joe0.com\/2019\/09\/28\/visualizing-jpeg-exif-using-python-how-to-convert-jpeg-meta-data-into-excel-travel-log-and-google-map-of-all-visited-places\/) \n\n\\--\n\nPythons out there, let me know what you think...",

Read this chapter; take this quiz; write this 10-page paper so on and so forth. It feels dead and boring. I have only had one class that has had anything to do with coding and it was OK basic Java nothing too crazy but it was fun.\n I want to create programs and games for children with learning disabilities. This has been a recent passion of mine after many years of feeling lost I finally feel like I have hopefully found my calling in life. I also want to make gaming controllers for gamers with disabilities to be able to play a wider range of games.\nSo my question is when it comes to finding a job in IT will employers be more likely to hire me if I have a degree in CIS or can I teach myself to the point where I have a good understanding of coding and past work to back it up? I would love to hear about how you landed a coding job and what steps you all took to get there and was it worth it. Thank you in advance for the help. ",

   "description":"The fall semester of college is creeping around the corner. This will be my second year, however, I will be formally admitted into my major once my summer class is credited to me.\n\nAs much as I have been trying to find information, I cannot find all of the sub-fields that CS has to offer. I have found threads on this sub, but it hasn't resolved my lack of information. Ideally, I would like to be well rounded in most areas when I graduate. I find the CS field to be very interesting, for more than just coding. While I know absolutely nothing about it, I love playing around with networks and the stuff that most people don't typically see. I find it very interesting to understand how all of it works. I hear about courses I will have to take and I have no idea what it is.\n\nI feel lost in my major. I have messed around with code very little before college, but the first time I have actually done something with it was from my programming course. It feels like all of these other people as far into the degree as me are so much more capable. They understand a lot of the sub-fields whereas I can really only answer to two, they know more about programming whereas I only know very elementary C++. For example, I didn't even know what SQL was, I still don't really get it, but it feels like everyone else knows what they're doing.\n\nI want to be able to code, develop software, work with security, work with networks, set up databases, understand and create algorithms, all of it, I just don't know how to focus on an area, let alone fully understand the areas so I can determine which I enjoy the most. I hope to be rounded in all of the areas because I am genuinely interested in all of it and I believe that is what will point me in the right direction, but by the time I get enough experience with all of it I feel that it will be too late to choose electives for which sub-field I want to verse myself in more of.\n\nPeople recommend working on projects and finding internships. I couldn't find an internship this summer, nobody wants someone who can only code very basic C++ that will run on a console. As far as projects go, I don't know what I could possibly work on that could be used in resumes and such given how much knowledge I lack in this area as of now. People keep suggesting to learn code online in my free time, but I don't know what language to start with and I always eventually hit a road block early on that I can never figure out because the information is not as detailed as I need it to be, instead, when I get stuck on certain functions of the language, I get sent down this rabbit hole of information and all of it is overwhelming because I don't know the general information. I don't mean for it to sound like I cannot solve problems, what I mean is that I don't have all of the fundamental ideas, I still don't know what database structures are for example, so it complicates things when hitting those roadblocks.\n\nI just need help, some advice to point me in the right direction. I need to know what to do or who to talk to because I want to become very skilled in this area. I am passionate about it because it interests me so much, I want to do the right things to benefit myself as much as possible. Thank you for the help.",

   "description":"Hey guys. I'm sure you get these kind of questions a lot and I've been reading around the FAQ and all but I have to say I'm still a bit confused and unable to comprehend all the information being put towards me. Right now I'm attending community college and plan on going for a bachelors degree in physics (though I've mostly only taken core classes so far). The only problem is I don't really plan on going for a graduate degree in physics, which has lead me toward the option of going for a job in software or some programming field. The general idea I've gotten from reading around is that computer science degrees don't always necessarily focus too heavy on learning up to date programming tools and such, but that the general skills you learn make it easy to transition into using those tools. So I've been pondering about whether I should just go for a computer science degree if I want to get a job in programming or software since it would help me more easily transition into learning up to date software or web development. In short, I want to go for some type of programming or software\/development job, so I am wondering if getting a computer science degree would help me go into that easier than a physics to a nontrivial degree.",

   "description":"Hi all, wondering if anyone is interested in having a real, accessible, and fully stocked food pantry available to CSUF students? I'd like to talk with some students who are suffering from some kind of food insecurity, and who is aware of TuffyBites and and finds that not extremely helpful or applicable to them (aka don't want free pizza and donuts, but do want free produce\/beans\/rice\/breads\/cereals\/granola bars\/pre-packaged foods and actual nutritious and filling food to bring home).\n\nI'm in the same boat and would love to talk with anyone who feels they'd benefit from it. I'm on food stamps currently and would love access to a real food pantry with regular daily\/almost daily operating hours and a variety of food available. You can message me, comments, or maybe if you're interested in getting involved come with me to some future meetings to talk about it with staff. \n\nThanks!",

I miss the long hike it was from lot g to the humanities building because my lazy self had to leave an hour before class started and not three hours to get a good parking spot. I miss seeing the ads for all the different clubs and sporting events. I miss running up two or three flights of stairs to get to class because the elevator was out again. I miss studying in the TSU at those long tables and being with all the other people studying. I miss being in class cracking jokes with the professor and asking people how hard they think the tests will be. The thing I liked most about school on campus was that everyone there was there to make their life better. Even though we had different majors, even though we were different races, even though we came from different income levels, we all went to that place to have a better life. I felt like I was productive there even when I was goofing off on my phone in the library. Now since I work from home and take classes online, I don't feel productive. I feel like I am doing the bare minimum. I really hope the school opens back up for fall",

   "description":"Hello Titans!\u00a0\n\nCarol here. I\u2019ve been a mod here for about three months now. Seeing this community grow and thrive within the last year has been awesome, we\u2019re now at almost 7k members!\u00a0\n\nThat being said, the mod team and I know we can always improve. We want to best utilize this space to better serve you guys, and so we\u2019re currently having discussions about ways to accomplish that.\u00a0\n\nWe would really appreciate any input you guys have about how to implement changes or tweaks that would help this community out.\u00a0\n\nFor example, something that\u2019s currently up for debate among us that I brought up would filtering out excessive posts regarding surveys. I\u2019ve noticed they hardly get much attention and are usually scrolled over. I might feel a certain way about them, but what do you guys think?\u00a0 In addition to this, another moderator proposed updating the side bar. Pursuing this even further, another member of our team suggested adding rules against doxxing, threats of violence, and privacy violations of other student's information.\n\nIs there something you wish were handled better? Any recommendation at all?\n\nI went ahead and asked a few of the other mods if having a singular post dedicated to this topic would be alright, since I really want to open up the channels of communication between us all, to increase transparency and your voice in this sub\u2019s development.\u00a0\n\nWe ultimately came to the consensus that it was a good idea, please feel free to sound off bellow, your opinion would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\n\nThe rest of the mod team and I look forward to incorporating your perspectives into any future decisions that we make regarding the sub\u2019s future.\u00a0\n\nAll opinions and criticism of our performance so far are welcome so long as they are expressed in a respectful, mature, and constructive manner.\u00a0Please keep in mind that most of us on this team are students in fairly competitive majors, and are doing this willingly and voluntarily with no compensation except your satisfaction. \n\nPS- If you don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing your opinion on such a public forum, feel free to PM me or message modmail directly. I want to make sure you have your voice heard as well, and that nothing impedes you from coming forward.\n\nHave a great rest of your night, \n\nCarol",

I spent three years in college doing electives trying to figure out what I want to do and I love comp Sci. But I haven't programmed until the semester before I got into the major and took all my easy, least time consuming courses already.  I am also generally a slow learner, but I do my time and I do my best. My logic is it doesn't matter how you do as long as you enjoy it and do your best, and yes, I am on the C-B- side if the spectrum for most courses except for a few. \n\nBut lately, these elitest, those who are the fastest learners, or have experience, or just gets it better than I do,  make me feel like i shouldnt be here even though I think i deserve to be here because I worked to be here and that's why I got here. I spent my time looking for what I enjoy most and this is it. Even if a lot of these elitest who don't say it to me, but rather those who might complain and\/or are in the same position as me (but obviously more vocal about it), the responses they get tend to make me feel crummy and depressed.\n\nHowever I've been in an internship and been told I'm doing great because I do the time needed and work outside of work, so it's reassuring but I just get bothered by the elitism that tell other students they shouldn't be in the major...

   "description":"I started my CS degree when I was 31 years old. I\u2019m 33 now. Obviously, it was awhile since my last math class. I tested into Math 70 which is beginning algebra.  For context, my son in 8th grade is studying what I did in my first class.\n\nI\u2019ve taken 8 math classes since I started (we do quarterly years here). There were times I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it but I studied a LOT, watched countless YouTube videos, exhausted google, went to tutoring sessions, went to office hours, the list goes on.\n\nTomorrow, I\u2019m taking my final exam for the last math class required for my degree. I\u2019m more than ready for it.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in CS, don\u2019t let the math discourage you. No one is a natural. Anyone who is good at math worked very hard to learn it, and it may be different for other students, but it actually got easier as I took harder classes. \n\nSo that\u2019s all. If a 30-something high school dropout who had to learn to plot numbers on a graph and how the hell fractions work can do it, you can too.",

Today we thought it was time to officially release PyBoy v1.0.0 on PyPi and GitHub!\n\n[https:\/\/github.com\/Baekalfen\/PyBoy](https:\/\/github.com\/Baekalfen\/PyBoy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/g484d4\/video\/hd2yupa7bst41\/player\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jEpnRRz.gifv](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jEpnRRz.gifv)\n\n## What is PyBoy\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a Game Boy emulator written from scratch in pure Python, with additional support for scripting through an API. We\u2019ve added type definitions, which allows us to compile the software using Cython to get performance comparable to emulators written in C and C++.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe installation instructions are simple: Install SDL2 on your system, and install PyBoy through `pip install pyboy`. If you need to compile from source, we also have detailed instructions on the GitHub Wiki for Mac, Linux and Windows.\n\n[https:\/\/github.com\/Baekalfen\/PyBoy\/wiki\/Installation](https:\/\/github.com\/Baekalfen\/PyBoy\/wiki\/Installation)\n\n## Features\n\nPyBoy is designed to be accessible from Python, so we support and encourage people who want to make experiments, bots or AI\u2019s to try it out. We are building game-specific wrappers, which at the moment allows programmers to interface with Tetris and Super Mario Land, without any intricate knowledge of the Game Boy. Documentation can be found at: [https:\/\/docs.pyboy.dk](https:\/\/docs.pyboy.dk\/) .\n\nWe also want to learn and experiment with more exotic features. Based on work from a university project, we\u2019ve added rewinding to the emulator. Which means, you\u2019ll be able to turn back time in any game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/g484d4\/video\/zofcwc78bst41\/player\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nr9VWwe.gifv](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nr9VWwe.gifv)\n\n## Feedback, Contribute, Learn\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear your feedback, and see the projects you wish to use PyBoy for! We will do our best to make it happen.\n\nPlease give any feedback in the comments below, on our Discord server or create issues\/pull-requests on GitHub if you wish.",

   "url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/computerscience\/comments\/eisywr\/algorithm_optimization_question_shatterproof\/",
   "description":"Hey! I was asked this pretty neat question during an interview and it's really stuck with me. The question:\n\n> You're working at a light bulb company and are tasked with testing a new shatterproof light bulb. You need to find out what floor the light bulb shatters from. You have access to a 100 story building, and only 2 light bulbs. You know the light shatters within those 100 stories. If both lights shatter but you find the floor, you succeed. It's Friday, and you can't go home until you're done. Therefore, you should try to **complete it as fast as possible.**\n\nI've been thinking about it a lot and how to completely optimize this problem. My initial answer was:\n>!Drop the first light bulb from the 50th floor. If it breaks, start at 1 and go one floor at a time. If it doesn't, go to the 75th floor, repeat. This is an OK answer, but it's definitely not optimal. There's a 50% chance that break height h is less than 50. If so, you have to try 50 floors, + 1 for the initial drop.!<\n\nTake a second to think about how you would answer the question and any optimizations you could make to do it faster.\nHere's my furthest optimized answer: >!Drop the first light bulb every 10 floors until it breaks. Once it breaks, you've narrowed it down to a 10 floor range. At a maximum (90+ break height), this takes 10 drops. Then, starting at the minimum of that 10 floor range, drop at each even floor (or you could do odd). This takes 5 drops. Conclusion, at a max, this method will take 15 drops to find the answer.!<\n\nI'd love to see what other ideas people have!",

I have the schedule, the books, etc. (THIS IS DONE JUST FOR KNOWLEDGE, MIT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A REAL DEGREE, BUT THE HOPE IS THAT YOU LEARN AS MUCH AS AN MIT STUDENT)\n\nEDIT 15\/04\/2017 Link to the curriculum that I made: [MIT CHALLENGE CURRICULUM](http:\/\/imgur.com\/QwigriC) \n\nAre you suited for this?\n*People who is interested in Computer Science\n*People with time to learn Computer Science, this may not be a formal degree but you should take it like one\n*People with discipline\n*People friendly and willing to collaborate\n*People wanting to be tech-entrepeneurs\n\n\nWhat I did before starting and some tips:\n  1) I planned it for a month due to several things. I'm from Venezuela and I have my own company. I live of the money that I make. So I bringed a friend to my company and make him a business partner with the condition that he has to do all the work. This was perfect since I'm doing 8 hours per day of study. \n   2) Another thing that is important and people forget it; a good CHAIR. If you're going to spend 8 hours every day, 4 hours on weekend, a  good chair is an important thing and not just a furniture.\n   3) I made a lot of noise of what I was about to do with my friends and family in order to make this challenge a real thing and keep a little of pressure on me.\n   4) Economic situation here in my country is ugly, so it's not common to have your own house, even if you have money. So I live with my family and they make a lot of noise, luckily for me, my house is not small and I fixed a room-garage just for studying and work.\n  5) I study an intensive week of pre-calculus before starting just to remember some math that I forgot\n\nA little thing about me: I studied Philosophy first and then Economics in college, I never finished none of them. I started my own company and that was my life three years until now. I always hated school and college, but I never hated to learn. So I started to see that I didn't need the traditional educational system to learn. That's when I heard about the MIT CHALLENGE done by Scott H Young. Inspired by him, I made my own curriculum and my own structure on how to accomplish this, I'm going to write later some rules that I made for this.\n\n   Two days ago I started with my first subject, Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python. I'm going to test if it's possible to finish this first subject within the time that should be done and if I can keep with the hours per day. I'm starting to see that the feedback when you're doing programming problems would be nice with another students.\n\nNote: I want to add that my native language is NOT english, so there are things that are a little harder for me to understand while studying than to a native english speaker.\n\nNote 2: I want to clarify that many of the subjects are electives that you can choose. \n\nEDIT 16\/04\/2017: Everyone who joins to the slack team are encourage to look first the two posts, \"Team Community Rules\" and \"General things about this team and the Challenge\" in the channel #general_rules, then you can proceed to start in the #how_to_start channel",

   "description":"I have been in the Army for 3 years now. I have a bachelor's in computer science. I plan to leave the Army on September 2020.\nMy girlfriend is in Germany so I'd like to start my new life over there. The issue is that I'm an American who graduated from school, joined the Army and haven't really got experience in my field. In addition to this, I'd be starting out in a new country looking for a new job; as a foreigner competing with natives. \nI'd like any advise, statistics or guidance on this. I want to start my new life right, and I have about 20 months to do it. Please help.\n\n**tl;dr: Moving to Germany in 20 months, and I need guidance on job prospects for Americans in Germany in Computer Science**",

   "description":"I'm on the edge to uploading all the material I have collected from students and past interactions with the department to the CA Department of Education. This department has failed to reflect on its poor status too many times. Starting with unprofessional professors, poor department management, unethical teaching standards and lastly prioritizing pushing our degrees over teaching actual material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: The reason I decided to make another post ( original post i made during my previous semester  [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csuf\/comments\/e6dec7\/csuf\\_computer\\_science\\_department\\_is\\_a\\_joke\\_and\\_so\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csuf\/comments\/e6dec7\/csuf_computer_science_department_is_a_joke_and_so\/)  ) is to emphasize how much work this department needs. I heard that the original post has picked up the attention of students, professors as well as the department chair. Unfortunately, from my understanding, nothing was resolved. The department is still in horrible conditions, unprofessional professors are still teaching and students are spending money on an education that could be taught via youtube tutorial or google searches. \n\nAlso, to be frank, a lot of the students that said that they were interested in making a chance and were tired of their situation, bailed. I unfortunately cannot be taking action for the entire computer science student body. I cannot be the only one complaining to the department, to the chair, to the school. If the issue really is as bad as all the evidence provides, the only thing left to do is get the students involved and make the effort to change the school.",

   "description":" 1:59 PM 3\/11\/2020, Statement from President Fram via student email:\n\n**CSUF Plan to Transition to Virtual Instruction**\n\nDear Titan Family:\n\nAs   referenced in the campus-wide communication from President Virjee   yesterday, the rapidly-changing information and guidance provided to us   by the CSU Chancellor\u2019s Office along with local and state public health   officials require that we be equally dynamic in our efforts to prevent   the transmission of COVID-19 on our campus.\n\nTo be clear, **our campus remains safe**, and while we continue to **have zero presumptive or confirmed cases of COVID-19** on or related to our campus, we are bolstering our preventative and social distancing measures to include the following:\n\n1. Effective   tomorrow, March 12, 2020, CSUF permits and strongly encourages all   faculty to commence the delivery of non-face-to-face teaching modalities   to the full extent that it is feasible and in service to course   requirements. All instructional spaces on campus have been equipped with   audiovisual tools to facilitate the delivery of remote teaching.   Faculty may choose to deliver the course content through synchronous   (real-time) or asynchronous (on-demand) modalities.\n2. Effective   March 17 and March 18, virtual teaching will temporarily become   mandatory for the purpose of a two-day technology trial that will help   prepare the campus for full mandatory non-face-to-face delivery.\n3. Effective   March 19 and March 20, the voluntary period in bullet one (1) above   will resume with faculty strongly encouraged to continue to teach   remotely and\/or virtually.\n4. Effective   Monday, March 23, and Tuesday, March 24 all face-to-face AND virtual   instruction will be suspended with the exception that normal   asynchronous online classes will continue as scheduled. The purpose for   these two non-instructional days is to allow faculty and staff to make   the final adjustments for alternative delivery teaching.\n5. **Effective Wednesday, March 25, CSUF will suspend all in-person and on-campus convening of classes** **until April 26th, 2020**,   with that date being subject to reassessment based on circumstances as   they develop. During this time, faculty will teach all of their  classes  remotely through the use of the above-mentioned technology.\n\n**To Summarize:**\n\n* March 12 - voluntary but encouraged virtual instruction begins.\n* March 17 and March 18 - virtual instruction mandatory for technical trial.\n* March 19 and 20 - voluntary but encouraged virtual instruction resumes.\u00a0\n* March 23 and March 24 \u2013 two non-instructional days to adjust and prepare.\n* March 25 through April 26 - virtual instruction mandatory.\n\n**The campus will remain open during every phase of these precautionary efforts,**   and students continue to be welcome to utilize all on-campus  amenities,  including housing, food services, the Health Center, the  library and  CAPS. Concerned students are free to limit their physical  engagement  with the campus, but offices and buildings will remain open  with  uninterrupted operations; staff will continue to work on site.\n\nCertain   courses and activities, such as some performing arts and laboratory   research, will continue to meet face-to-face with approval from the   respective College\u2019s dean. In these instances, social distancing   accommodations will be implemented. We will continue to work on possible   non-face-to-face modalities for these classes as well.\n\n**Faculty**:   You will receive further instruction and support from Academic Affairs   and IT along with your deans and chairs. Further communications are   forthcoming.\n\n**Students**:   Please check in with your professors and look for communications from   them for their plans in the courses you are enrolled in. If you have   questions, please contact your professor.\n\n**Staff**: Further communications will be sent to you from HRDI. Contact your supervisor if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nAs   set forth in the communications to our community yesterday, CSUF will   continue to monitor any spread of COVID-19 and issue additional notices   as necessary. Information is available and will be regularly updated  on  the University\u2019s website at [http:\/\/coronavirus.fullerton.edu\/](https:\/\/nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoronavirus.fullerton.edu%2F&data=02%7C01%7C%7C38ee83fbc5424a5b24d708d7c5fe9c22%7C82c0b871335f4b5c9ed0a4a23565a79b%7C0%7C0%7C637195569631056407&sdata=uOh4D%2BcY7WIFhG8GbBVTBgMppbEQ0l%2FShruJlaufQ0w%3D&reserved=0).\n\nThank you for your continued cooperation, empathy, kindness, and support.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFramroze Virjee\n\nCSUF President\n\nPamella Oliver\n\nCSUF Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\nMark Stohs\n\nChair, Academic Senate\n\nAaron Aguilar\n\nASI President",

   "description":"[A letter in my own handwriting](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/W4ZIk).\n\nI learned Python in 1998, and I used it pretty much daily through my working life. Its connectivity with everything has allowed me to do all kinds of interesting and fun things. When I discovered that the [AxiDraw](http:\/\/www.axidraw.com\/) pen plotter has a [Python binding](https:\/\/github.com\/inconvergent\/axidraw-xy), I decided to try writing in my own handwriting with my own pen. Something I've been unable to do for years.\n\nIt has taken a lot, mostly because I can't type, so I've been limited to voice recognition and copy and paste, but the letter linked above is where I got to this evening.\n\nI thought I would share my mini triumph.\n\nI've learned and programmed in a lot of different languages over the years. I have written several languages myself. And even though Python wasn't my first language, it is the first language I consider for any new project. I'd have to have a compelling reason to use something else. So thank you, Python, for making this possible.\n\n<\/ shameless preaching to the choir> ;)\n\n---\n\nEdit: In the comments a couple of people asked for a video. I will make a proper video with the AxiDraw as soon as I can. [We just did a quick test](https:\/\/youtu.be\/W5YGwNlO53A) on my wife's Cricut craft cutter. It works there too, though you can't tilt the pen or change the pressure. So apologies it's not the proper plotter, but you can see how the paths are traced on this video.",

   "description":"I'm in university and it feels very difficult to keep up with the pace of everything. During semesters I spend about 1 to 1,30 hours in total for commute every day; very often, as soon as I get home (or even during classes), I feel like I'm totally drained and I can't get anything done at all for the rest of the day. \n\nWorking on programming excercises and projects takes me quite a lot of time, not necessarily because I find them hard but because I want to make sure that I'm doing the best that I can and that I'm really understanding what's going on (otherwise I would feel like something is missing or \"it's not as good as I would like it to be\/think it should be\"). \n\nBecause of this I'm left with little time to do any actual studying and usually I'm just too tired or \"bored\" to even start or I can't find the right focus\/mental state to approach the matter in an effective way; it's kinda like I'm always mentally or physically tired or there's some external factor or something I keep thinking about that provides me with distractions that make me interrupt often what I'm trying to do.  \n\n\nKinda wrote this in a rush because I'm heading out, will try to expand on it later if you want.",

I am in my second year of college and taking my second programming class currently (Java) and find coding very fun and challenging. I love every aspect of it. However, my math grades have been awful. I got a C- in precalc and am currently taking Calc and Discrete math at the same time due to my University's requirements. \n\nI know I have to practice to get better at calc and I am beginning to get tutored and starting to understand it a little more but what can I do for discrete math? I can't wrap my head around the concepts, I simply just don't understand it. Is there a book or a video that can help me at least begin to understand the basics of it? Im struggling and my first test is in two weeks.\n\nP.S. What jobs can I get in comp sci field with not too much math involved on a day to day basis?",

I know how many algorithms work or how they interact with objects but I don't know how to use them nor how to write them. I manage with the programming assignments mostly due to google and StackOverflow, I feel like I don't write much of the code. I keep getting stressed out when there are multiple people in my class who have worked as programmers before starting university and they do the assignments perfectly with code and functions I can't understand. \n\nI'm good at the math but I fail to understand how it will help me or how it works with programming. I dropped out of my latest programming course because I couldn't even understand the first assignment. I keep telling myself I'm gonna read a book on Java so maybe I can get up to speed, but I keep finding excuses. My family keeps asking me to apply for summer jobs at IT companies because they keep thinking \"Well you know the basics now right? You can do something at least?\", and I feel like I don't know anything.\n\nDid any of you ever feel like this during your studies?",

   "description":"Hey all.\n\nI just started learning python last week. I started at code academy, just focusing on some of the basics and understanding the idea of fuctions, variables, rules of syntax, etc. It was fun and surprisingly easy to get into. After a while, I decided I wanted to really see what I could do to use some of this knowledge to my advantage. I stumbled onto this website https:\/\/automatetheboringstuff.com\/ which had a nice little rundown on automating keyboard and mouse presses. \n\nI do a lot of repetitive data entry. The software we use at my job is bloated and clunky, so it is not the funnest to navigate. Throughout the years I've perfected manually entering all the information I need to, but it is really tedious and would take me about 5 minutes at top speed. \n\nThis is where python comes in. I ended up, over the last week, working on the below code to automate entering data in 4 of the most common scenarios I come across day to day. I know it is a mess. There are a lot of redundant pauses and code that may not make sense. I'm still learning, but I am so happy that I finally got it all working how I envisioned. \n\nMaking a GUI was harder than the mouse\/kb automation. But it makes the data entry so much easier than having to manually edit values in the script and run them one by one. This way, everything pops up and I can just tab away to the fields I need to enter. \n\nAll in all it took about 12 hours of work. But now it cuts those 5 minutes of boring data entry to 1 minute of not having to do anything (with plenty of room to work on bringing that down!) Unfortunately I can't show you the script in action for security reasons. If there is anything that you notice that could be improved, please let me know. The GUI is horrendous but functional in its current state.\n\nI know this is not the most exciting or useful thing for anyone but me, but I was literally rushing with adrenaline when it was finally all working. \n\n[Here's what the GUI looks like:](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Nm4qTIA.png) I was going for that early 2000's software crack vibe. Just missing the shitty midi music.\n\n[And my desktop icon to run the script](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2OZBHZ0.png) \n\nAnyway, not to ramble on. Just wanted to share a story as someone who went from absolutely no knowledge to actually producing something worthwhile in a short amount of time.

   "description":"Hi there! \n\nI'm a CS student and I've read recently Mark Weiser's paper. He talks mainly about ubiquitous computing. I loved the paper btw.\n\nI want to discuss some concepts that he talks about. I know that it's a paper from 1997 but still, it's a good one. \n\nPlease, read the paper here:\n\n[https:\/\/www.ics.uci.edu\/\\~corps\/phaseii\/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf](https:\/\/www.ics.uci.edu\/~corps\/phaseii\/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf)\n\nIt's really worth, and it's just 8 pages long. \n\nNow you've read it. Let's talk :)\n\nSo, IoT is the ubiquitous computing that he was talking about, right? At first, I thought of cellphones, but those still have 'a demanding focus of attention', the screen. But IoT, those are devices that we do not *see,* I see a coffee machine not a computer, I see a better fridge, a better clock, a better oven. Not computers. Those *disappeared*.\n\nHe talked about pads or tabs. We can say that these are today's smartphones and tablets, right? And the boards, we may think of them as today's smart TVs, but a big screen is just not that popular. But today smartphones, smart TVs and tablets are still not a form of ubiquitous computing so... quite similar but not exactly what he thought.\n\nI think that the network that Mark describes here is already invented:\n\n>Present technologies would require a mobile device to have three different network connections: tiny range wireless, long range wireless, and very high speed wired. A single kind of network connection that can somehow serve all three functions has yet to be invented.\n\n4G. 5G. If I misunderstood let me know. \n\nHere's the final paragraph of the paper: \n\n>There is more information available at our fingertips during a walk in the woods than in any computer system, yet people find a walk among trees relaxing and computers frustrating. Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.\n\nI think that this is yet to happen. And that will always be like that because technologies evolve so fast that the majority of society just can't catch up. \n\nMaybe ubiquitous computing is not even possible. It's just a utopic concept. And trying to get to that utopic place where computers vanished into the background will make great things happen, even if we never get there. \n\nOr maybe ubiquitous computing isn't good at all. What do you think?\n\nI'm amazed by how he talks about things that we see today, before those things ever existed! \n\nAny insight from the paper, please comment :)\n\nPS: I hope to upload some interviews with some CS Doctors of my Uni or simply a blog post about ubiquitous computing somehow soon. Thanks for taking the time of reading this, I know it's long :)",

   "description":"Hello r\/python! A couple of months ago I\u2019ve done something that I never thought I'll do\u2026 that was to mentor someone to learn how to code in python.  \n\nHere\u2019s the course lessons\/projects on GitHub: [https:\/\/github.com\/purcellconsult\/Cracking-Python-Bootcamp](https:\/\/github.com\/purcellconsult\/Cracking-Python-Bootcamp)\n\nInstead of including tons of dry text that makes the eyes hurt, I figured that I\u2019ll try something a little different. For a little backdrop, each lesson was initially a live coding session that used a combo of Google Docs\/Skype. After each lesson I added the code to a python file, wrote comments, and pushed it to GitHub.  \n\nI tried to make the code as self-documenting as possible so that it makes intuitive sense. I think this approach is more hands-on and thus inspiring for those who have an appetite to learn how to code. Anything that\u2019s not clear can be Googled along the way which IMHO reduces the learning curve.  \n\n**TL\/DR**: I\u2019ve mentored someone for 12 weeks in python. Here\u2019s all of the [course files on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/purcellconsult\/Cracking-Python-Bootcamp).",

By the second semester I started to become more and more confused. I am currently completely lost. I can keep up during lectures and I follow along perfectly but as soon as it\u2019s time to do a lab I have no idea what to do.  I keep going back and forth on whether or not I want to change majors. Part of me wants to get out this way I have more time for a social life and less stress but the other part of me wants to continue because I really feel like this is something I could love to do. I was wondering if anyone experienced something similar and if it gets a bit better the longer you stick with it. I heard the first three semesters they try to weed people out so I was hoping I could get advice on here.",

   "description":"Hello Titans! Here is another post bitching about the expensive parking, so disregard if you hate seeing these posts. \nMy girlfriend goes to LBSU and I recently found out that she pays roughly $300 a YEAR for parking while we pay $300 a SEMESTER. This completely blew me away considering that LBSU is also a CSU and they don\u2019t have to fight in the hunger games for parking each and everyday as we do. \n\nWhy are we paying twice as much for this horrendous parking situation that is MILES behind LBSU\u2019s? I get we have a parking structure currently paced to finish in the fall of 2020 but even that got delayed by a whole year and prices STILL went up. I seriously believe the school should be transparent as to why parking is so expensive. \nI struggled to pay the permit last semester and this semester I planned on doing the shuttle service for $80 but discovered the shuttle closes at 7pm when my last class is at 8pm. \n\nI believe the students shouldn\u2019t be pushed around and expected to shell out $300 per semester on a system that is virtually a scam. There are 40,000 students that enrolled at CSUF in 2019. Even if half of those students bought parking, we are looking at the school getting $6,000,000 in return. Where is that money going? Do they seriously need to be THAT expensive?\n\nThis might not go anywhere but to my fellow Titans, be aware that the school is clobbering us with this parking permit price.",

   "description":"I know some people would say posting things on the internet is not a good idea especially related to my own feelings.. \n\nIt's been a bit I posted a thread stating I am exhausted to do anything.\n\nI am actually an international student, but have a citizenship that I am not part of the international students department. But I grew up outside the us where English isn't the first language. I came here when I was 19 by myself, and went to CC with health related major but in the last moment before getting nursing school, I changed my major to a complete different major. (I won't share the details since privacy...) During my CC, I took longer to transfer because the school required me to take ESL classes since English isn't my first language..But that was totally fine with me. I always wanted to study here and I was just living my dream at school.\n\nHowever.... outside of the CC time, it was absolutely horrible.. I cannot mention details about it but it actually made me ended up in a psych unit that my family actually have to fly all the way to here to discharge me, since only family members could get me out. Then I went back to my country dropping all the classes except the online ones, and spent the rest of the semester with my family. \n\nDuring that horrible time before ending up in a psych unit, I actually lost all my happiness (before my friends and families always told me that I look like I never had a hard time because I am always nice positive smiley girl) I actually don't remember when I actually was happy laughing ever since psych unit.. \n\nAfter coming back from my country, I took the last requirements at my cc but had another horrible time that one of the professors harassed me in an inappropriate way. I reported to school after talking with one of my lab teachers and school eventually wiped the record of taking that class from my record and I was dropped from his class. The school explained things to CSUF and the class isn't really a must class for transfer that I should be fine. However, it's a main basic stream class? to my major, meaning it delayed my graduation at CSUF. \n\nI transferred with 4.0 GPA and hoping for amazing school year since CSUF is one of the schools as I really wanted to go as I heard the professors care more about students than the professors at UCs. (The reason why I didn't choose UC to go, I had to take more classes since it requires more than CSUs.)\n\nBut now I realize that I didn't in the past, I wasn't taking care of my trauma, that my moods would swing rapidly up and down. My boyfriend who was by me the whole time when I go through things, told me to see a doctor but I refused, since that horrible time was over and thought time would heal it. However, it actually just got worse and worse to the point I couldn't take care of myself. I would even be really anxious when my boyfriend isn't around who is not really able to come see me everyday since his work is here and there and he lives an hour away. Lost story short, I eventually went to the doctor but it took 2 years from the incidents of horrible time to get the treatment. \n\nIn the beginning I was finally able to sleep and get back on studying that I actually love to do. However, the person who provided the horrible time was still connected to me even though I tried to get away, that still gave me hard time occasionally. I didn't face the person, but actually my boyfriend is connected to the person but he cannot get away from the person for reason I understand in my head. So I just try not to think about the person... \n\nHowever, as semester goes study load was getting heavier than ever and my gpa is just on a stiff downhill from 4.0, and stress piling up to the point my meds do not work anymore. and the last post I posted when I was feeling everything was just nothing. \n\nI don't really share my feelings or any of my life events to my families and friends, except my bf that he knows everything and he is the only one I trust. So what they see in me is probably the way I described myself in the post.. \n\nWhat I really meant in the post at the time when I was writing the post I actually wanted to see what people would see me from the outside.. since I don't share any details of my life to anyone except my boyfriend, I was a little afraid. But I got a lot of positive comments encouraging me and I just want to thank you to who commented.. I actually cried for hours after reading a negative comment I am being a baby and have been in my parent's arms for too long when I am actually alone without any family members here.. I know the person didn't know the details but since my friends don't really know my family isn't here it felt like maybe my friends are looking at me as a spoiled brat.. (The only thing they see is me being in the middle; like I don't know how to say, but mostly they would be hey what's up are you okay and I would only respond with I am okay and don't talk much..)\n\nI don't know why I am writing all this, but my doctor is going to me give me evaluations tomorrow for more care... just wanted to take something off my mind before tomorrow.. If you read this much, I really appreciate it and thank you for your time reading it... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry to post such long stories but I hope everyone enjoys thanksgiving and do well on rest of the semester :D",

   "description":"Hey, everyone. I posted a couple of times on here before. But yesterday, after three years of panics, major changes, and many nights of feeling hopeless. I finally graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in Communications. Why did I bother sharing this on here? Well, I wanted to be a source of inspiration.  Two years ago, after too many bad decisions, I ended up getting academically disqualified, it was quite possibly the most difficult thing I have ever been through, telling people was difficult, it was essentially like getting being kicked out and it happened at the same time as I was dealing with other personal issues. But I still kept with it, I worked my way slowly back into the system, took a whole year, but I did it, changed my major in the process and I finally felt confident in what I was majoring in. I kept working hard, continued to be involved with my favorite club on campus, Adventure club, received counseling for depression and anxiety issue, and with help from financial aid, I achieved my degree. As I was walking through my commencement ceremony, I couldn't believe it, this is actually happening, I made such an improvement.\n\nSo now that I shared this all with you, I wanted to say to current students who might be in a similar situation that I am or may be doubting yourself and even thinking why are you still even in college, and I know this advice will be cliched, but what you are going through is normal, you are not week, you are not useless, you are still getting through it, and even if it's taking longer than four years, that's okay. It took me longer than four years as well.\n\nTo my fellow graduates, Congratulations on all of your accomplishments, and to the current students, keep at it and don't give up, in the end, it will all pay off and your family and friends will be so proud.\n\nAnd thank you to CSUF for the memories, even if we didn't agree on everything.\n\n",

   "description":"While I was waiting at the library to be opened this morning, I was talking with this older gentleman in the mean time. He looked like in his older 60s'. At first, I thought he was a student that went there, but he mentioned being homeless during our conversation, which made more sense since he had a bunch of stuff with him such as parasail umbrella, containers, etc. I was asking him some personal questions regarding his past life and how did he ended up living on the streets. Long story short, he was electrician technician for a large aviation company back then until it was outsourced somewhere else. The guy was no idiot. He was a well spoken gentleman that knew what he was doing. He told me he prefer using the computer on universities compare to public library because of wide availability of computer and usage. (Also he said it gets him out of trouble lol) he said he's trying to get his master communication degree from I assuming a trade school. I was just curious if I should make a gofundmepage for this guy. I don't know the actual protocols but if i happen to see him again on campus during the weekends , should I ask him for permission or just take his photo conspicuously and just post his situation up without his permission. If I had too judge for myself, he doesn't seem like to have a free handout. He didnt ask for money or nothing. But if given the opportunity he told me he hopes to work as electrician consultant because of his age. (too tired for manual labor) overall I just believe this guy deserve a 2nd shot living his rest of his life in sheltered place rather than roaming on the streets with his bike. ",

I have a pretty good grasp on Java and C++ and was thinking about picking up a new language.  Maybe a scripting language? (not interested in front end dev but feel like I need a grasp of how things are implemented)  Or am I better off just honing my skills in languages I already know by working on random projects?  I just feel that there are plenty of people that are at my level of education and are much more capable than I.  \nAny suggestions are helpful.  Thanks.",

The other 10 will be about math. I'm coming from a social sciences degree, and would very much appreciate if you guys can direct me to some good readings on the computer science-y aspect of the test. They were clear that knowledge in programming is not assumed and is not required, but the applicants are expected to be proficient in problem solving and to be able to draw logical conclusions from given information. The test will be administered on the following Monday, so I think I have enough time to read up. Thanks for the help!",

   "description":"Hi, I'm in a little bit of a weird situation in that I'm a Physics student who's pretty interested in CS and might switch my masters from Physics to CS, after which I've been told going into research\/PhD could be a possibility too. I've never really considered academia in CS and don't really know anything about the state of it, seeing as I'm not an actual CS student right now. So I'm trying to ask around to kind of gauge I guess what it's like, how easy it is to get into, how demanding it is, how fixated on paper publishing it is (physics certainly is) etc. I just always see CS students talk about getting jobs is all and never academia, but I'm unsure if that's because of money being a big motivator in why people go into CS in the first place (it's not too much of a concern for me) or because it's worth avoiding compared to private sector environments. \n\nI get it would help if I could be specific about \\*what\\* I'd want to research, but I'm still only in second year and more just thinking ahead right now, so I can't be too exact. Generally though, I know that security, anonymity and cryptography are big interests of mine. \n\nAny info would be appreciated, thanks. ",

I don\u2019t have a formal education in computer science or technology so can anyone recommend books that can supplement this lack of background knowledge and CS theory? ",

I currently work a full time factory job that I hate. Is it a good idea to pursue a 100% online degree or is this something I really need to go on campus for ? I'm also not great with math I don't know if that matters or not. I've always been fascinated\/interested with computers and I know there's some good career choices out there and I really feel like its a career I would enjoy. Where do I go from here ? Is there any good websites to teach me a little more complicated stuff so I can really see if this for me or do I just need to jump straight into classes ? What math do I need to brush up on ? Any advice or help of any kind would be greatly appreciated.",

Well, these are your student fees going to ASI and I will be honest, I have seen too much of them gone to waste. I currently serve in the ASI Executive Team as the Chief Communications Officer and have been frustrated to see how ASI hasn't met what it could potentially be.\n\nWe just had the ASI President & VP Debate last week (you can watch highlights here: [https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9hkTQnD0H1\/](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B9hkTQnD0H1\/)), but I still want to give as many students possible the opportunity to ask us anything. I have been roaming around this subreddit for a while, but haven't really posted much myself so interacting with you all here will be fun! **Feel free to ask anything about myself, Amaya, and\/or our platform!**\n\nVoting is super easy! Beginning tomorrow (March 10th) and ending on Wednesday (March 11th) at 8 PM, students could head over to [vote.fullerton.edu](https:\/\/vote.fullerton.edu) on their phones, laptops, etc. and vote. It takes less than 30 seconds and hopefully when you vote, you end up voting for Isaac Gonzalez and Amaya Gregory. Let me know what questions you have!",

   "description":"Hi guys! After a lot of hard-work and sheer determination I have mostly completed my book, \"Intermediate Python\". It will receive updates over time :)\n\nIt has a couple of issues related to grammar and technical info in it. I am working on ironing them out one by one.\n\nI was a bit lazy so didn't upload it earlier but here it is now.\n\nI have decided to distribute it for free! I wanted to give back to this awesome community so this is what I have to offer for now. I am sure that it would help those who really want to be helped. Best of luck! \n\nHere are the links:\n\n- [Html](http:\/\/book.pythontips.com)\n- [PDF](http:\/\/readthedocs.org\/projects\/intermediatepythongithubio\/downloads\/pdf\/latest\/)\n- [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/IntermediatePython\/intermediatePython)\n\nIf you like this book then a simple [tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/yasoobkhalid) and a personal email <yasoob DOT khld AT gmail DOT com> would mean a lot to me!\n\nP.S: The book is open-source so if you find typo or technical error or just want to expand it's contents with your own knowledge then just send over a pull request :) Moreover, if you want to give me any tip then kindly pm me your email and I would let you know once I setup a tip-collection system.\n\n**Note:** This is not related with that **paid** \"intermediate Python\" book in any way. I became aware of it today. I had been using this name internally for a couple of months. If the author of **paid** \"Intermediate Python\" has any issue with this I would be more than happy to change the name of my book because he definitely beated me to the finish line. :) \n\n------------------------\n\n**Edit:**\n\nHey guys! All those of you who are going to use this book can really help me and motivate me by letting me know how this book supplements your day to day learning and if you are a Teacher, Assistant Professor or something of that sort then kindly let me know if you would be willing to offer this book to your students or not. :)\n\nYou already have my email address or if you want to tweet about it then you can do so at [@yasoobkhalid](https:\/\/twitter.com\/yasoobkhalid).\n\nMoreover, I really can't thank this community enough. This community has helped me a LOT over the years. If you see my Reddit profile then you can easily guess that this is the only community (\/r\/python) where I spend most of my time.\n\n------------------------\n\n####Edit:\n\nYou guys can donate me if you want to by buying the donation version of Intermediate Python from [@gumroad](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/intermediate_python) :)\n\n It is only for $10 but if you want to pay less then kindly let me know (pm) and I can give you a custom link.\n\nCheers!",

   "description":"I just finished my junior year of high school, and in it I took AP Computer Science A (Java). I absolutely loved the course and writing code, however I'm not sure what to pursue after it. I would like to complete a project, not only for fun, but also to put on my college application. I did really well in the class, and am almost positive that I made a 5 on the exam. However, I feel like creating a game or app might be beyond what I have learned, and would like to go in this direction. What are some books I can read, some projects I can start, or other things that can help pursue my interest in Computer Science?",

   "description":"I've been preparing for an on-site interview with Microsoft for a new grad position (SDE 59?) almost every night for the past month in between classwork and felt pretty confident solving medium questions on leetcode. So I wanted to get some real feedback from actual developers in the industry\/at big companies to see if I was up-to-par with entry level expectations.\n\nI went through Gainlo and got matched with a senior engineer supposedly from Oracle for $150. He literally [asked me a leetcode question](https:\/\/leetcode.com\/problems\/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal\/description\/) and basically didn't accept an answer that didn't match the top one even if the algorithm was the same. While I was coding he was typing away and chuckling about something on his end. When I would ask him a clarifying question or explaining my algorithm he just said \"uh-huh\" or \"yes\" occasionally and was overall just not engaged.\n\nI finished coding a solution about 30 minutes in and he hurriedly tried to wrap up the interview because I'm sure he's paid per interview without any standards. All he told me was that it wasn't the most optimal solution, it didn't compile, that I should try to study more, work on my resume. His advice was read up on AVL trees(?), ubiquitous computing, SQL joins, bit manipulation, and some other obscure stuff which made it seem like he was totally out of touch with how interviews work now. To top it all off, he sent me some follow up feedback template with some high level, generic tips in all of the sections and the \"correct\" solution which really showed he was just winging it.\n\nWhen I complained to Jake\/Gainlo, they said that they could not arbitrate and that it was my word against his and that he had worked with them for a very long time and that this never happens. Jake basically said that I was being too sensitive about the feedback and that the best he could offer was a 50% discount on the next interview, which I assume would be with an even more novice interviewer. \n\n[Proof](https:\/\/imgur.com\/BJe6dHk)\n\n**TLDR: All they care about is the short term and raking in money. NO QUALITY. SCAM AS HELL**\n\nIf you're reading this \"Jake\", screw you. If I had done even a modicum of research I would've seen this coming. Even the broken English was a dead giveaway.",

I am thinking about the post bacc from Oregon State University, but is a masters more sufficient, and what programs are designed for people that have some background in computer science but not a lot? I have more of the math though up to 55, but didn't take CS70. Anyways thanks for everyone's help!\n\nI took\n\nMath 1A Calculus I\n\nMath 1B Calculus II\n\nMath 53 Multivariable Calclus\n\nMath 54 Linear Algebra\n\nMath 55 Discrete Mathematics\n\nCS10 Snap Programming\n\nCS61A - Python Programming\n\nCS61B Java Programming -Data Structures (I got a D+ which is passing at UC B)\n\nCog Sci 131 - Used Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCourses I had left did not take\n\nCS70 - Discrete mathematics and Probability theory\n\nCS61C - was required and was programming in C - been learning C on my own though similar to Java",

   "description":"I have these as candidates:\nLisp\nReasonML\/Ocaml\nErlang\nLua\n\nMy goal is to learn a FP that will help me in the most general sense, and will show fruits early on.\n\nI've narrowed down to two: Lisp versus Ocaml.\n\n**Reasons for Lisp:**\n\n* Emacs - I can learn Emacs and use org-mode!\n* Paul Graham recommends it\n* It's supposed to make you a better programmer\n\n**Reasons for ReasonML\/Ocaml**\n\n* ReasonML: perhaps this is the future of React, and I'm a frontend developer.\n* This will be like killing two birds with one stone: another frontend stack + FP\n* Ocaml is supposedly even used in financial sectors (Bloomberg for one)\n* Ocaml can compile to machine code. That by itself opens up a lot of possibilities\n\n**Reasons for other ones**\n\n* Erlang: apparently this was in HackerNews recently due to Elixir being a secret tool for rapid development\n* Lua: I have ESP8266 boards that use Lua as the language (I changed them to use Arduino IDE at the moment), and Lua is also a scripting engine for games.. so I maybe can make adventure games..?\n* Haskell: apparently this is better for something but I forgot.\n* Smalltalk: learned this in school. Maybe I can get started on SICP with Smalltalk?  :) ??\n\n",

It abstracts a lot of things behind cls, uses tons of one liners, and now I\u2019ve got a Dev who is enforcing strict typing on every code review (not necessarily bad, just kinda weird to see type declarations in Python).\n\nMy style typically breaks one liners into methods or multi-line flow control blocks for easier reading and understanding. I try to keep things explicit and self-explanatory for V everyone. Have I been doing it wrong?\n\n\nEdit: thanks for the insight, everyone! Got a lot more answers than I expected :)",

   "description":"Good morning,\n\nHope you're all having a nice Tuesday! So recently I went and saw my academic adviser regarding Computer Science and what if I decided to switch. Turns out I have lots of time to make a decision, and I don't really need to choose until the beginning of 2nd year, if I want to change majors.\n\nThe only thing really is just I have some fears about the program. I've read online, like on Quora, etc. that if you weren't A) Programming at like 4 years old, and B) If you didn't get A's in math, don't even bother.\n\nAs some of you may know from me posting here, I will be taking a CS elective next semester, but I'm worried that even if I do like it, and I do switch into CS, that I will do bad in all the other classes, like Intro to Programming, and all the upper year classes.\n\nAs for math, I don't need Calculus surprisingly. I need \"Graphs, Functions, Geometry\" and \"Sets, Logic, Number Theory\" at the 100 level and then Matrix Algebra in 2nd year. (I'm doing a BA, so the other maths aren't required.)\n\nBut I got Bs in high school math, and a whopping C- in Grade 12, last year\n\nI just don't want to make a mistake and then fail out of school because its too hard for me or something, but I also don't want to earn a degree (my current, Kinesiology) where I don't even think I could do any tech, considering I wouldn't qualify for any tech related Masters.\n\nAnyhow, sorry if this post is not allowed. I just didn't know where else to ask. ",

Yes, lots of ones and zeros; I welcome any feedback.\n\nWhen building the adder circuit from transistors--because I want this not to be an exercise in theory, but something concrete you can lay your hands on--I discovered a mistake in the first video.\n\nSo that got edited, new animations created, and the video explains my mistake for posterity. And here's [the new version.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TDBAbJ-SO5E&index=2&list=PLbWOAOC929Ky_oKFVIXYaaeIo8-7lSENe)\n\nI've also [created a new YouTube channel](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC359DSgwAoG0w68aU2tA8sQ)--and have updated the links.

   "description":"First, a bit of background:\n\nMy background is a law degree, but I have found a great interest in technology and programming when I started to learn Java as a hobby. As I learn more, I realise that the circle of 'what I need to know to be effective' grows ever wider. For me, it is insufficient simply to understand how to write a loop, or a method etc.\n\nThere seems to be a vast amount of CS which is not simply 'programming' which I am missing out on by only studying a language. A few of these topics I have seen are Data Structures, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Networking, and even 'How a computer works!!!'\n\nI feel that a broader knowledge would help me understand better exactly what I am doing, and all of the jargon which honestly goes over my head. \n\nSo, my request: is there a list of recommended topics for general understanding of computers, computer science, and, following on from that, a reading list you would recommend for each topic that is suitable for self study for a beginner?\n\nMany thanks in advance.

   "description":"I am an undergraduate CS student at the moment. Just hit the halfway mark of my program. I have always had an interest in teaching CS, and I always thought it would be at the university level. Lately though, the idea of being a high school computer science teacher excites me. I\u2019d love to introduce CS to teenagers and get them excited about it. I feel like too many people are intimidated by programming, and I would like to help bring confidence to students who have some interest. It would be cool to even teach some AP classes too and cover things like data structures. \n\nSo my question is, what\u2019s it like teaching CS in high school, and how can I make this a possibility for me?\n\nThanks in advance!",

   "description":"Congrats to CSUF police for finally catching the serial masturbator that has terrorized the campus for seemingly months. I can finally graduate knowing that he will stroke no more, and that students are safe from his incessant jerking.\n  \n  \n\nUpdate: The suspect of the October 4th crime alert has been arrested by CSUF Police.  We want to thank our community for the great leads and for the witnesses that have come forward and have been working diligently with CSUF Police Detectives.  Due to outstanding teamwork by an additional eyewitness, CSUFPD Dispatchers and Police Officers, the peaceful arrest of this suspect, who is a non-student, was possible.**\n \nOriginal October 4th Crime Alert:\nOn Tuesday, October 3rd, at approximately 3:26 p.m., CSU Fullerton Police Officers were dispatched to South Campus Drive near Dan Black Hall regarding a report of a male subject allegedly masturbating in his vehicle.  When officers arrived on scene, the suspect had left the area.  Officers subsequently interviewed a female student who told them that she was flagged down by the suspect who was sitting in a silver Toyota Camry.  The vehicle had a partial license plate number of \"5VW\".  The car was parked along the South Campus Drive round-a-bout.  As the student approached the car to hear what the suspect was saying, she noticed the individual was not wearing any pants and appeared to be masturbating.  The suspect then drove away and was last seen eastbound on Nutwood Avenue.  The suspect was described to the officers as possibly being \"of Middle Eastern descent\", in his 40's and wore a dark colored tee shirt. \n",

   "description":"I was going through my posts this morning while I was waiting for my morning coffee, and saw u\/sleepy815 's post \"Feeling discouraged with C++\" and wanted to pass on a word of encouragement to the community, collectively, for those of you beginning your Journey or struggling to continue.\n\nFirstly, I most definitely encourage your continuation of your pursuit of Computer Science. It's *hard*. In fact, as a Computer Scientist, you are a professional \"creative\" problem solver.\nBy the very nature of what we do, we must be agile in approaching each problem, as our field is continually changing and moving in many, many directions. It can be hard to keep up with it all, and incredibly daunting to even approach. \n\nEven once you've reached your stride, you may find it challenging to take it all in; so I wanted to share my story and its incredibly unlikely destination of CS. \n\nIn High School, I wanted to be an artist. More specifically, I wanted to be a character designer for some video game \/ movie company. However, come time to apply for college, after a great deal of contemplation and discussion with my parents, I opted to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering (but I had a history of being rubbish at maths). I had a slight taste of programming with a class on Visual Basic (which hardly counts). \n\nThen, came college. Freshman year was *exhausting*. Never before had I experienced a real programming language; but in our introductory course we learned C++ and Python. In retrospect, these concepts aren't as challenging as I *perceived* it to be. This was an insurmountable obstruction. I struggled vehemently, and to make it worse, I had enrolled in the \"advanced\" section, wherein you were expected to have prior programming experience. I came in expecting visual basic and found, instead, the monster of C++.\n\nI felt as though I was at the bottom of the pack, taking hours against my peers' alleged minutes to complete an assignment. \n\n*In fact*, come the end of my class, I had proudly proclaimed that:\n\n##I am never taking a CS course again! \n\nI was so excited; CS was a huge challenge and I finally managed to endure to the class's end. Turns out, I hated Electrical Engineering, but I felt trapped, I had no other options. There was nothing I liked!\n\nBut, this couldn't have been further from the truth. I missed the challenge contained in each assignment and the triumph I felt upon finally submitting my *masterpiece*. \n\nSo, I went back. \n\nThis year, I am a Junior in College, though I am a Sophomore in the CS program, here. I have a solid 3.7 in my CS courses and I couldn't be happier with my decision to stick it through.\n\nPoint being, everyone starts somewhere different. Hell, I am a year behind! (My girlfriend, a Freshman, is already taking many of the courses directly prior to mine...which sucks, but I'm still making *progress*). In fact, I have failed every single Calculus class I have ever taken before passing it (not a C- or above). Discrete mathematics and onward were no problem, but it's not like I didn't struggle! \n\nAs long as *you* are better at what you're doing today than when you were yesterday, that's all that matters. \n\nSo, do your homework, struggle through your project, pursue your interests. It *will* pay off. You'll be happier for it; you'll experience that legendary satisfaction, and if you're devoted, you will out-mode your peers or colleagues. \n\nIf a pleb like me can figure it out;\nyou, kind friend, most definitely can.

This one's for you guys.\n\nIn the hope that this will be received by the entire student body, I write to you all with the objective of bringing us together, as students, as Titans, but also as humans. As of late, we have been barraged with emails from our university, regarding our current circumstances of a potential apocalypse. I wanted to send a message not for the purpose of doom, but for the sake of camaraderie and empathy. We all know about social distancing, along with the \u201csafer at home\u201d order issued by the state, the panic that we see on the media from people in lines at Costco, the numbers game that airs during every news segment that minimizes human lives to either lives that may be lost or that unfortunately have been. I\u2019m not writing this to tell you what we should be doing in the face of this global pandemic, no instead I am imploring you to be YOU. Find ways to express yourself, innovate your mind and soul out of this lonely island that we have been placed on. In times of crisis like this, we\u2019re seeing the worst in some, but let us not forget that we are the many. We are neighbors, schoolmates, friends and more. Let us do what Titans do and shape the world with our hearts and mind. Let us reach out to one another and lift one another up so that we may all stand tall together, far away from the loneliness. Like the lamp post flags state; Titans Reach Higher and we\u2019ll reach them together.\n\n Wishing all of you, and your families, good health during these turbulent times.   \n\nBest Regards,   \n\nBen ",

I asked a Phisicyst but he was analphabet with code :P so I'll talk with some Computer Science professors at my Uni.  \n\n\nSo, I wanted to ask you, anyone has some code that outputs the draw of a fractal? Share it please! That would be awesome. Also, any experience on the topic would be helpful too. Some code in C I couldn't run it because it includes graphics.h, and I'm using Linux so I'm trying to export an image instead of use that.  \n\n\nThanks in advance!",

Being someone who commutes to school- I often looked forward to being in the environment of our campus despite the fact that I didn't have anyone to hang out with...I just liked being around people. We're so used to virtually communicating with people that most of us feel like this isn't going to be any different for us...but it is!!!! No more (at least for a while) passing strangers and sharing a smile\/nod or having interesting stories to tell someone about what happened on our commute...or on campus or what we overheard that day....\nNo matter how much I feel this change to virtual education provides me a little more time to do things my way...it will feel like an eternity...\n    Stay healthy everyone and good luck on the rest of the semester.",

Are there specific languages typically used for synths\/midi instruments, or does it depend on the company and\/or what works best for the specific project? Is this a field that I should take some design classes for? It would coding and a design portfolio be good enough in most cases?\n\nAny help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

   "description":"Hello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo , I am new in CS field and I am looking for ways to improve my algorithmic  and problem solving skills. Basically  trying to think more like a \"modern\" programmer.\n\nI have found hackerrank and tones of similar sites with problems to improve my skills but I really don't know if its worth it focusing there or if its better to improve my skills while working on a project.\n\nAlso I have some experience with programming languages.Most with C\/C++ and Python , but I don't know which language is \"the best\" for problem solving. I've seen many people recommending python but   for me C++ (although its harder ) feels more \"absolute\" in syntax than Python.\n\nSo a sum up:\n\n1. What do you recommend to me for improving my problem solving skills.\n2. What language should I choose for it?\n\nThanks in advance",

   "description":"Hey there everyone, first reddit post... I'm writing because I'm honestly burnt out trying to figure out what to do next. I'm sorry if this becomes a rant \\(it will\\) but I just need to vent out my whole situation, this is also going to be therapeutic for me... my questions will be in **bold.**\n\nI graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from some obscure university in the Middle East in December. I'm not sure how much I've gained from this degree, it doesn't feel like much given what's happened so far but I know I enjoy developing and I've definitely learnt useful skills which will always be beneficial to me. This degree wasn't all that mathematical and didn't really dive into core computer science principles at depth but instead focused on touching on all these principles and proceeding to take the next semester's fees.\n\nI've even done some side projects to learn what it's like developing practically and that's been more than positive, I've even published a visually appealing but not too technical app on the Play Store. I've interned at a collaborative maker space where I used to give workshops on hardware like Arduino and RPi, it wasn't entirely technical since these workshops were pretty basic but still, it helped with working on computer hardware, my public speaking skills, and meeting some interesting people. \n\n\\*I should mention that my overall grades aren't too great in the CS subjects on my transcripts, I've struggled personally for no good reason throughout my undergrad and it's reflected on my grades in the more technical subjects and it does affect my confidence in this field at times because I can start measuring myself by those grades\n\nI moved to Canada soon after I finished university since I'm a resident; I want to continue studying and start a career in software engineering over here but it's been rough so far. I applied for a Master's in Computer Science at several universities in Ontario \\(Carleton, Ryerson, Waterloo, Western and some more...\\). I've been rejected by all the ones in parentheses. I applied for a coursework Master's \\(where they're available\\) because I have no idea what research to work on, I felt as if I was lacking the skills for a thesis and thought doing a coursework degree would help me settle in the country and hopefully help me find what I wanted to work on in the future. I also applied for part\\-time status as I felt I could try and work at the same time, my thinking is that all this status and degree type stuff can change later on if it's necessary, I should just focus on sending an application and get into a school. I visited Waterloo to see the campus and talk to the graduate office for Computer Science as well, which imo was a positive experience. \\(**Did I go about this right? I researched all the programs for a long time but it felt overwhelming because besides knowing I want to work on AI, I didn't know much more\\)**\n\nCarleton was the first to reject me, and then Ryerson, after this happened I really felt as if getting an acceptance from the rest, namely Waterloo & McMaster, was far\\-fetched because they're all better than these two. Sure enough, that's what happened. I contacted someone at every university after I received my rejection emails to ask for the exact reason my application was declined, and also to provide me with a way forward. Ryerson was the only university that really provided me with sufficient feedback, saying my GPA was too low, and advised I could try enrolling into a Bachelor's in Canada and shave the relevant credits off with my previous degree. That felt ridiculous, that I'd have to dig up my high school transcripts \\(not great reading, btw\\) and apply ALL OVER again for an undergraduate degree, when people are getting their offer letters. Additionally, I didn't do math in high school so I knew that'd be a roadblock, I'll come back to this.\n\nRyerson at least talked to me, I even visited the campus and Chang School of Continuing Education to talk to their advisors about what to do next. Waterloo sent a *manually typed automated message* about how competitive the process is and how many factors are taken into account for the application, I don't even know how to respond to this email \\(open to suggestions\\). Carleton, meh, not a great experience. Western didn't even respond back. \n\nI expected this whole process to be tough especially with my university transcript, and I was and am ready to do any extra work to gain admission but the fact that the universities have been so unhelpful in talking to me is very disheartening. I feel like I'm doing something wrong in the way I'm approaching this, maybe I should just move my ass and go to the campus and talk to them physically. \\(**Can I open a dialogue up with the universities through e\\-mail and set up a meeting with them in person and trying to ask them when I'm there, it just feels very pointless given all that's happened thus far.\\)**\n\nI tend to get anxious which I can work through, but once I'm there I just hear the same stuff that I've seen online which ends with saying that the whole application process is online and that I can't get personal advice pertaining to my situation besides any extra questions I might have about the programs. Additionally, the admin faculty isn't that open to giving personal advice until you're actually a student, something mentioned explicitly on some universities' sites. \n\nSo, I'm coming off some serious depression because of all this and some other personal stuff but I've started feeling better and I'm finally thinking clearly again, ready to start the grind once more. Working off of Ryerson's advice, I'm open to redoing a Bachelor's in CS. I know this might seem like a step back, but I also know that settling in Canada is really tough after talking to friends and family, perhaps in the long run this won't seem as major as it does now. \n\nI'm even willing to go back to do the required high school courses as well because I could finish them off this summer, plus applying through a school is MUCH easier since I'll get a Canadian HS diploma with my old school grades \\(British\\) converted in the process, and I could talk to an academic counselor which I feel I desperately need. Also, I'm thinking if I'm going to do an undergrad degree again, I might as well fancy it up by double majoring with Neuroscience because this is something that I'm deeply interested in, even my computer science interests lie in AI so I know that a combination of these two fields could prove valuable in the future. **What does anyone who's made it this far \\(thank you, btw\\) think about this idea?** My school background is mainly in the sciences in any case.\n\nThat's the education part of it, I've also been trying to get a job or an internship in Canada but that hasn't proved very fruitful. I've signed up on job sites, LinkedIn, and a local service called Career Edge that helps new grads and newcomers to Canada get paid internships to gain experience in the country and land a job in the future with that experience and networking. Career Edge has really been the only helpful service, they helped me build my profile while I was overseas and the one internship I applied for was with them; the interview went really well but in terms of skills they wanted someone who knew C# and I've been raised on C\\+\\+ and Java so I didn't know the proper syntax and intricacies of it, plus the logic question threw me off \\(swap an int without a temp variable\\). They got back saying that they needed someone who knew C# because there was no time to train someone from scratch. Besides this, I don't know how else to go at it with a foreign degree and that's why I'm focused more on the education, I'll get a Canadian degree, I'll gain some much\\-needed knowledge, and going to a university will naturally open up opportunities in the job market. \n\n**Should I try finding a job instead of the whole academic pursuit I'm planning on doing? I feel as if doing a job will be good in the short term but to progress further I'll have to study more later on so I might as well set myself up now. Plus, having done a Bachelor's already I'll be much cooler about it now by being open to all the opportunities like taking time off to work if needed.**\n\nThanks to anyone whose read this and I'll appreciate all the responses! :D\n\nI'd add a tl;dr but I'm gonna be lazy because I've spent a while typing all this out plus it all ties in.\n \n ",

This is important because you can have all of your essays and important school document deleted so be careful!\n\nCredit: Markiplier",

   "description":"I'm currently deciding on a major and I really don't know if CS will suit me.\n\nI really like mathematics and I'm pretty good at it. Applied Mathematics is certainly suitable for me but the thing is that I don't know if I want to choose a major that only revolves around maths. \n\nI also like working with technology and I have a huge passion for video games. That's why the CS major caught my interest. I have done a lot of research and I definitely took a liking to software developing and website designing. However, I have 0 experience when it comes to coding. I did a very basic programming tutorial a few days back and it was a lot of fun for me. I'd love to learn more about programming and taking this major.\n\nI have talked to my parent about this and my dad does not support my decision at all. He is constantly arguing about how this major isn't for girls and requires people with experience. He says that CS major is for people who loves programming from a young age and started learning about it in elementary school. Even if I can make it into the major, he says that I will probably always be one of the worse and most inexperienced student and that I will have an awful time looking for jobs when everyone else is better than me. He really really really wants me to take another major like Data Science, Architecture, or something medical. Redditors who are\/were in a CS major, is what my dad says true? If yes, to what extend?\n\nBesides maths and video games, I also like art, design, photography, fashion, architecture, and biology. The reason I don't want to take the Architecture major is because it requires high grades in physics, and I am very average in physics. I don't want to study art\/fashion stuff because it would be sooo hard to find a job. And I don't want to take Biology major because I'm only interested in the plants parts of it. \n\nSome other things I can add are that I am fairly creative and I can quickly adopt to new technology and softwares. I'm always very careful with everything to avoid mistakes and I prefer working alone and independently. Things I am bad at are languages, physical education, and writing essays.\n\nDo you think that a Computer Science major will suit me? Even with no knowledge in programming (yet)? (I mean, we go to school to learn right?) Or is there any other major you'd like to suggest? Please, any help would be amazing! Thanks in advance :)\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for the positive words and advice! All of you have convinced me and I have decided to choose the CS major! Thank you again, I appreciate every comment",

Real predatory feeling as they won't take no for an answer and make it seem like you're turning down some exclusive opportunity (as get rich quick schemes typically do).  Don't stand for this harassment and report they asses to management\n\n\nBrunette female late 20s\/early 30s hooks you in before Tall average build dude with black hair and goatee comes in to act like \"nah we shouldn't get them involved (\/scammed).\" They target young couples that seem nice enough to engage coversation with but then just won't leave and hold you hostage in coversation before talking about how they want to let you in on their mentor who retired all young and rich. But then they talk about \"possibly\" setting up a coffee meeting and ask for your phone number but get shady when you ask them for more info or refuse. I even tried offering my (spam) email but they're like \"oh he doesn't have email.\" Got to be phone(?!). Dafuq bitch it's 2018 my grandma has an email and there are even dogs that have their own IG but somehow your rich ass friend doesn't do email for business communications. \n\n\n\nMy girl and I were approached by them at Target on Yorba Linda Blvd by school last year (2017) and caught onto their shit quick. But today at Costco (Fullerton, closest to school) we overheard and witnessed the same couple giving the same schpiel to another unsuspecting couple. We stalked them for a bit to confirm and after they finished their final shady sales pitch, my girlfriend and I approached the unsuspecting couple and asked if that couple mentioned a mentor who can get you rich too. They confirmed and we told them what we knew. Went to Costco's staff to end this shit. We looked for them and what do you fucking know they're back at it again with another couple smh\n\n\nTL;DR creepy couple harassing other young couples shopping about some rich and young mentor but just want your number and hook you into Amway's MLM (multi-level-marketing), get-rich-quick pyramid scheme. Don't let them steal your time because that bitch will talk for days",

If you have MFA set up you will be taken to a sign on page for reddit to allow Social Amnesia to work properly without having to send a new token every hour. Twitter will have the same login process whether you have MFA set up or not.\n\n\\- I've added information text to the login page of the app so that people will know what the limitations of the API are for reddit and twitter.\n\n# What is this?\n\nI\u2019m excited to release 1.0.0 of my side project, Social Amnesia! This completely free and open source software allows you to wipe out old reddit and twitter posts, comments, tweets, and favorites, automatically and on a schedule. It also allows you to configure certain items to be saved based on configuration options like number of upvotes, favorites, or retweets, whether an item has been gilded, how old an item is, or by specifically whitelisting items you would like to have saved.\n\n# Who is this for?\n\nYou may be wary of what you post on reddit, twitter, facebook (if you even have one), etc. However, I can imagine many of your friends and family are not. At the end of the day, the safest you can possibly be is to not use any social media. But I think the war on drugs and abstinence-based sex-ed proves everything we need to know about telling people to \"just say no\". What I believe we should be doing is working towards solutions that help reduce the damage that destructive activities can cause. This is why I've built Social Amnesia, which lets you keep your social media history clean with just a few button clicks, and set it up to automatically clean proactively (instead of reactively, after something bad happens to you).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of the tools out that allow you to manage reddit and twitter history are either very user unfriendly (require you to operate command lines and work with scary configuration text files) or cost money. I wanted to develop one that had a convenient user interface and was built to be completely open source so it could be checked to be sure it had no nefarious purposes. I believe the free aspect also helps get people to actually try and use it.\n\n# Why would you need this?\n\nIf you've been following the news recently you've probably seen cases of celebrities losing out on big career opportunities because of tweets or other internet posts from their past coming back to haunt them. [Kevin Hart and The Oscars](https:\/\/variety.com\/2018\/film\/awards\/kevin-hart-says-the-film-academy-has-given-him-an-ultimatum-apologize-or-well-find-another-oscars-host-1203083698\/) and [James Gunn and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3](https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/heat-vision\/james-gunn-exits-guardians-galaxy-vol-3-1128786) are two of the more high profile examples of this recently. Make no mistake, this could happen to anyone, not just high profile individuals. If you are going to tweet, cleaning up your old tweets is one of the best ways to keep a nightmare like this from ruining a potential job opportunity or relationship. Since twitter is mainly focused on current events, and as far as I can tell it's rare for people to look far back in someone's twitter history, this shouldn't effect your day to day interaction with twitter.\n\nOn the reddit side of things, many people maintain pseudonymous accounts to post in places like \/r\/sex, \/r\/politics or \/r\/trees. The more reddit history you have, the higher chance you have of being doxxed by someone who might comb through your posts to try and scrape together details to de-cloak you and reveal your real identity. Keeping your reddit history clean is a good deterrent from being doxxed.\n\n# Concerns\n\nI've received concerns about this software when I've posted it before. I'll try my best to detail some of my arguments here, but please leave a comment if you have anything to share and I'll do my best to respond to you.\n\nOne of the main concerns I've heard is from people who've gone back to an old reddit post and there have been deleted comments that might have been useful for them ([semi-relevant xkcd](https:\/\/xkcd.com\/979\/)). I hear you, and to try and combat this I've added some features to this software. The first is a whitelist window, which as far as I know is the only of it's kind in free management software for reddit. Opening this window shows you all of your comments or posts and let's you pick ones to save from deletion. Additionally, when you do go to delete anything, the software will show you every item that will be deleted and ask you to confirm your decision. This software doesn't do anything that isn't possible for a user to do by simply going back through their comments and deleting them.\n\nI realize this isn't a complete solution, so I'd recommend using this software only if you use your reddit or twitter accounts for more current events or sensitive topics. If you provide helpful advice online and want to make sure it's preserved, *be careful using this*.\n\nThe second concern I've heard is related to backups, archives and having a false sense of privacy around using this software. Obviously I can't delete anything from reddit or twitter's internal servers, and I can't remove something if it's archived somewhere else. And I'm also limited by their APIs (which I've detailed [here](https:\/\/github.com\/Nick-Gottschlich\/Social-Amnesia#limitations)). However I've done some research, and backups of reddit and twitter are sparse, incomplete, and often hard to find and access. For a while the library of congress was archiving every tweet out there, but they gave up when that became too difficult a task due to the sheer size of twitter. Unless someone is actively archiving your posts, there is a good chance that deleting a tweet or reddit item will actually remove them from the internet.\n\n# Screenshots:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Main Window](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jgyuszprkdh21.png?width=2538&format=png&auto=webp&s=d917de521bfff0fe5a4f4b23ecca08145f751e8a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Deletion Window](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/uyyso7pskdh21.png?width=1640&format=png&auto=webp&s=db04a63bf18544eaa8ad47eb61bba413c6847a10)\n\n&#x200B;",

   "description":"One of the upper division courses is cpsc-481, better known as artificial intelligence. If you are trying to get this class, avoid the instructor William McCarthy. From all my courses, he is without a doubt the worst teacher I've ever had. I am not speaking of this out of bias or spite; my current grade in his class is a solid A. With less than half a semester to go, I have learned little to nothing in regards to how AI works.\n\nThe project he assigns is far beyond our capabilities. It must be written in Python, meet a list of very specific criteria, and be completed within a short timeframe. Don't have experience with Python? Tough luck. He will not teach you; all he does is suggest Python intro books for you to read. Stuck on certain parts of the project? More readings. The most you can do is follow the reading, copy the provided code word-for-word, and hope it works. This is not learning.\n\nIf you ask him for help, he refers you back to the reading. If you ask for an explanation, he will provide a meaningless response. Below is a piece of code that he was asked to explain. We were expected to not only understand it, but also be able to write it all out from memory, as it could be on the midterm (which it was). Here is the response he pretty much gave us:\n\n>Okay, so first you import the necessary libraries. Then parse the arguments, load the dataset, and normalize from 0 to 1. Create the label names, and make a model for training. You fit the model, generate predictions, and plot the results.\n\nWell no shit sherlock? It's as if he looks at the code and reads a key word from each section. His replies are plainly obvious and not helpful whatsoever. It's similar to me going outside and saying, \"The sky is blue.\" We were never taught this MiniVGGNet model. It was not in our readings, nor was it used in our project. He just gave a brief overview of it and said it may very well be on our exam.\n\n    import matplotlib\n    matplotlib.use(\"Agg\")\n    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer\n    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n    from pyimagesearch.nn.conv import MiniVGGNet\n    from keras.optimizers import SGD\n    from keras.datasets import cifar10\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    ap = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    ap.add_argument(\"-o\", \"--output\", required=True, help=\"path to the output \n        loss\/accuracy plot\")\n    args = vars(ap.parse_args())\n    \n    print(\"[INFO] loading CIFAR-10 data...\")\n    ((trainX, trainY), (testX, testY)) = cifar10.load_data()\n    trainX = trainX.astype(\"float\") \/ 255.0\n    testX = testX.astype(\"float\") \/ 255.0f\n    \n    lb = LabelBinarizer()\n    trainY = lb.fit_transform(trainY)\n    testY = lb.transform(testY)\n    \n    labelNames = [\"airplane\", \"automobile\", \"bird\", \"cat\", \"deer\", \"dog\", \"frog\", \n        \"horse\", \"ship\", \"truck\"]\n    \n    print(\"[INFO] compiling model...\")\n    opt = SGD(lr=0.01, decay=0.01 \/ 40, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)\n    model = MiniVGGNet.build(width=32, height=32, depth=3, classes=10)\n    model.compile(loss=\"categorical_crossentropy\", optimizer=opt, metrics=\n        [\"accuracy\"])\n    \n    print(\"[INFO] training network...\")\n    H = model.fit(trainX, trainY, validation_data=(testX, testY), batch_size=64, \n        epochs=40, verbose=1)\n    \n    print(\"[INFO] evaluating network...\")\n    predictions = model.predict(testX, batch_size=64)\n    print(classification_report(testY.argmax(axis=1), predictions.argmax(axis=1),        \n        target_names=labelNames))\n    \n    plt.style.use(\"ggplot\")\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.plot(np.arrange(0, 40), H.history[\"loss\"], label=\"train_loss\")\n    plt.plot(np.arrange(0, 40), H.history[\"val_loss\"], label=\"val_loss\")\n    plt.plot(np.arrange(0, 40), H.history[\"acc\"], label=\"train_acc\")\n    plt.plot(np.arrange(0, 40), H.history[\"val_acc\"], label=\"val_acc\")\n    plt.title(\"Training Loss and Accuracy on CIFAR-10\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Epoch #\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Loss\/Accuracy\")\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.savefig(args[\"output\"])\n\nIn addition to the projects, which are already on a tight deadline, he gives articles that we must read, analyze, and write an essay about. It's just filler work, and has no purpose other than to take time away - time that could have been used to polish up our project. The articles simply discuss the origins of AI, and how it has advanced in the past decades. He grades them harshly and expects us to mention specific topics, even though there was no rubric or requirements provided. It was literally labeled as \"Summary\" assignment.\n\nI'm not a special snowflake complaining about him though. There are many other students who have expressed their distaste in him. He assigns a large amount of work, but skips office hours, and doesn't respond to student emails. Here are a few quotes from students in our class Discord chat:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yc7k2h0sqiz31.png?width=1435&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cf167402d0de29efd0ab4a2b93740bfb4bfa55\n\nSo if you're a cpsc student, please remember this advice before you select a class with him.",

   "description":"I think this is unusual for the subreddit, but I'm Prof. Huntington-Klein and I'd like to plug a new class I have this fall, called Economics, Causality, & Analytics (ECON 305, TuTh 2:30-3:45PM). I think it might be in the system as Causal Economic Analysis but we'll get that fixed.\n\nThe class covers the use of the statistical programming language R (which is looking pretty darn good in the job market these days, by the way), and also how to perform causal inference. Causal inference means using data to answer questions like \"Does X cause Y?\" e.g.  Does the minimum wage harm jobs? Will the new company policy increase profits? Does university prestige raise your earnings? This stuff is economists' bread and butter, and it's a big reason why so many tech companies are hiring economists these days. We cover what causality *is* and a set of methods for uncovering it.\n\nThere's no textbook to buy, and the only prereq is either ECON 100, 201, or 202 (i.e. \"take any econ class\"). Coursework includes homework, some exams, and a couple of very short papers (1-2 pages). The course counts as a 300-level elective. You'll probably still get something out of it even if you've already taken other econometrics classes (340 or 440).\n\nYou can see pretty much all the course materials [here](http:\/\/nickchk.com\/econ305.html) (which includes video resources) to check if you might be interested. You can see me discussing the philosophy behind the class [here](https:\/\/twitter.com\/nickchk\/status\/1114956341913645058) (plus some bonus nice words about the course from Justin Wolfers! Do undergrads know who Justin Wolfers is? Long hair, good economist, NYT articles).\n\nHope some of you will be interested, and maybe I'll see you there!",

   "description":"I need to get this off my chest, so please read my entire post instead of downvoting me based on my arrogant title. \n\nI am a computer science undergrad myself. I've always been fascinated with computers and the Internet ever since I was young. I simply cannot see myself working outside of this area - the incredible space for innovation and the power of exponential technologies is, to me, simply the most exciting thing I can think of. I constantly read about future technologies (shoutout to \/r\/Futurology) and find it disappointing that not many people share this admiration of mine, especially in this fantastic time period in which we live.\n\nI could spend hours talking about why I chose to study computer science, but I'll leave that for some other time. I need to talk about why I dislike my peers.\n\nI am definitely an introvert, but in my class of initially 50 people* I was probably the most outgoing. I haven't made many friends in college, which truly made me sad in the beginning because I could see myself making more (and better) friends if I were to study pretty much anything else. The only thing that me and 90% of my classmates have in common is that we, for different reasons, chose to study CS. Most of these people are your typical anime-loving gamers, which is of no interest to me. Most of them plan on focusing on game development, which is fine, but they simply don't have an open mind for other ideas an technologies. They play games and want to make games, as if that is even a realistic scenario. \n\nI don't even need to mention most of them are awkward as hell. This is no reason for me to dislike any of them, but it definitely makes it more difficult for me to bond with them. I have one good friend who shares common interests with me and doesn't act awkward at all. My other friends are nice people and (sometimes) good to hang out with, but they are definitely weird. I almost forgot to mention there is only one girl in my class, which really disappoints me, but I can't say I don't comprehend.\n\nI feel like we need more people in CS who are also interested in the arts and humanities, as I see this as an important trait for understanding the power of the technologies we deal with. As Steve Jobs said it, \"Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science, I like that intersection. There\u2019s something magical about that place.\"\n\nI think it is important to note that I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this is based on my point of view, I don't want to generalize CS students. I guess in a more developed country more people would be interested and open to the possibility of studying CS, and therefore providing more diversity among students. And that is exactly what I would like to see.\n\nI hope I haven't offended any readers in any way with my personal thoughts. I'm just very passionate about technology and can't seem to get the same vibe from the people I deal with on a daily basis.\n\n*I would say 50% of the people who started college with me already quit. Every semester some people leave, and we only had 2 (TWO) people graduating in CS last semester. But CS is hard, nothing new here.\n",

   "description":"To everyone who is saying that we just want to cancel class because we don't want to go to class:\n\nFirst of all, yes. Not going to class right now would ease a lot of people's stress about the virus, and being stressed (like most college students already are) leads to a lowered immune system, putting us all at more of a risk of being affected by the disease.\n\nBut second of all, there are some legitimate reasons for us to be concerned. My grandparents recently traveled from India, to London, and finally to LAX and at no point in their travels were they asked any questions about symptoms, where they were traveling to and from, and if they were running a temperature. They were traveling during the first few weeks in March. Although they did not go to any of the areas that are currently being impacted by the Corona Virus, they were being exposed in the airport to many people who could have potentially be carriers of the virus while being asymptomatic. Waiting until a case shows up and tests positive will mean we are already too late and many people will have already been exposed and the cycle will continue.\n\nNow how does this pertain to all of us? We are a commuter college that brings in students from all over California. Although there is no one who has been infected yet (knock on wood) our college and others like it would be an epicenter for the illness to spread all over California.\n\nI am not saying we should cancel classes altogether, but the idea of transitioning them to being accessible online would greatly diminish the possibility of the illness being spread to our loved ones and teachers to whom it would affect in a more negative way. As young students, we are able to fight this illness off more effectively than our parents or grandparents, so as much as I want to say that the students are my number one priority, that is just not the case. My main concern is parents, grandparents, and even our professors, many of whom are much older and the disease would have a much more significant impact on.\n\nTransitioning classes to an online format would also reduce stress on those who are already sick and don't come to class because they do not want their sickness to spread. In general, it should be much easier to get classwork and notes directly from our professors when we are sick and using an online format as well as \"zoom\" would provide for that.\n\nNow for those who are worried about the possibility of graduation being canceled. There is a much better chance that graduation will not be canceled if we do close down the campus for a little while. Graduation will absolutely be canceled if this gets any more serious, so closing down campus now actually means there is a better chance at graduation taking place. Closing down campus as soon as possible would prevent the disease from spreading around campus and allow for it to die out or a vaccine to be created by the time graduation rolls around. But if we continue to hold classes and someone does get infected, there is no way to tell just how many people it will affect and for how long.\n\nI hope you read this entire thing before taking to the comments and getting angry at me, but if there is anything I missed or anything I got wrong, please let me know. Right now the world needs more kindness and compassion, not hate or ignorance. Lets continue to work together as a cohesive student body to make our voices heard.\n\nI will be e-mailing a similar version of this to our school's president, Framroze Virjee, and I suggest you do the same if you have similar concerns about the virus and our campus.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the fantastic response. I really love the discussion this has opened up. Honestly, I was afraid to post because I was worried about backlash. \n\n For those who want to email the important people who need to hear your concerns (thanks u\/volcom-airsoft) here are the emails: \n\n[deanofstudents@fullerton.edu](mailto:deanofstudents@fullerton.edu)\n\n[academicaffairs@fullerton.edu](mailto:academicaffairs@fullerton.edu)\n\n[**presidentvirjee@fullerton.edu**](mailto:presidentvirjee@fullerton.edu)",

I can see a number of problems with this change in future:\n\n1. Now people will start relying on the order of elements in a dict and if Python developers want to change the implementation in future they will **have to** preserve the order as well.\n2. It forces developers of other Python interpreters to implement this feature as well even if it will cost them some additional work or decrease performance.\n3. It makes `collections.OrderedDict` redundant which could lead to confusion.\n\nWhat do you think about this decision? Why do you think they made it?",

I graduated with a degree in CS and got a job as a full stack developer at a government contracting company. Great pay, great coworkers, and I genuinely enjoy my day to day. Maybe it's just just human nature but once I got comfortable, I could not shake the feeling that I wanted to be doing something meaningful that really helped people. As much as I enjoy optimizing government auditing processes (not a joke haha it is enjoyable) at the end of the day I'm saving people who's lives are bureacuracy an hour of time here and there. Did anyone else experience this and stay in the CS industry? I love coding and I know there are likely many ways I can use it to help benefit others but I'm looking to hear people's experiences finding meaningful work to them in CS and how they got there.\n\nTLDR: love my job but looking for ways to program while also doing something meaningful",

   "description":"Hello,\n\nI recently started working with C\/C++ and I got to be honest, it's a nightmare. I understand the syntax and can code pretty well. The problem starts with different build systems and platform specific stuff. I undestand that to make something cross-platform I can use preprocessor #ifndef and all that stuff. But I am not confortable with all the different \"building and compiling stuff\" \n\nFor example, with javascript I know that all i need is npm or yarn and stuff to organize the dependencies and porting it to a new OS is just one command away. With C\/C++ there are different build tools, eg. ninja and make. And build tools for build tools (Cmake). There is the mess of  static and dynamic libraries that need to be linked depending on OSes. This is just so overwhelming. \n\nI can't make a decision. I am trying to make a game engine for the purpose of understanding the internals of games and it's a pain. I accept that this is what I HAVE to deal with if I want to even consider doing cross-platform in C\/C++. It's the part of what makes it hard. I get it.\n\nI really want to sink my teeth in this.  I want to know how do I build cross-platform stuff in C\/C++ from begining to end. Testing, debugging, using other libraries. I want to stay away from IDEs like visual studio and all (part of the reason i looked into cmake). My objective is to understand the code BETWEEN the algorithms that make up a program. I want to know how things are organized in a project. how large projects like cocos-2dx handle all the testing and supporting compilation on different OSes (not a gamebuilt with cocos but cocos itself).\n\nNow, that I have got that out of the way. What I want to know from you all is this: Is there a guide or a book that shows how large codebases in C\/C++ are made? Obviously one book cannot cover this all. I need proper resources that guide me through all of this. I don't care if it's videos, books, posts etc. Are there some open source projects that are easy but complex enough to help me understand this all? How should I proceed to undersand this?",

Also bit of web design with javascript,html and css. \n\nI've enjoyed both. And now i really want to learn js frameworks for personal projects but also want to continue with J2EE java OOP.\n\nMy dilemma #1: In order to get ready for the marketplace i need to pick a specialization i.e. backend (java, spring, hibernate) or front end (javascript\/react\/angular, html, css). The problem is I want to be a full stack ideally but also realize its smarter to pick one stack initially and become competent to be job ready (1.5 year until graduation). . \n\nQuestion 1. Is it realistic to focus on becoming a full stack as i graduate (1.5years left)? Or pick one path and be REALLY good at it. Im an average student and know it will take time\/energy to be good at any given path.\n\nMy dilemma #2: imposter sydrone. Yup, i don't have real workplace experience atm so i don't  know if I'm good enough. Assignments are great but not the same as working on real projects with colleagues and deadlines where you actually have to know your department.\n\ntherefore i think doing front end would be easy vs backend to get started? Even though i really enjoy OOP java a lot too\n\nAny insight from your experience for new graduate would be so helpful! (I've been over thinking too much)\n",

   "description":"Hello all\n\nI asked you people if you are interested in learning Python by writing a Reddit bot some time back on r\/learnprogramming. I received immense number of responses, so I'm posting it on r\/python. It covers the process, practices and tools involved in writing a Reddit bot in Python.\n\nPlease post your feedback and questions in comments, and I'll be happy to answer them.\n\n#**Requirements**:\n\n1. You are somewhat familiar with programming in general, and have an idea about Python or other languages (like what are variables etc)\n2. You  are on a Unix-like system with access to command line tools\n3. Familiarity with [git](https:\/\/git-scm.com\/) and [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/) (Not really required...it is better if you are familiar)\n4. A Reddit account\n\nEven if you don't meet these requirements...no need to worry!\n\n#**Introduction**\n\nWriting a bot for Reddit is easier than you think, because Reddit provides a structured method to access its data via the [Reddit API](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/dev\/api). There are amazing tools like [PRAW](https:\/\/praw.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/) which can help simplify the process. PRAW is a Python wrapper for Reddit, and it takes the pain out of the process of writing a bot.\n\n\nAnd as I said earlier, Python is an great language, which is easy to grasp for beginners. What even more amazing is it's community, which has made incredible open-source tools and libraries for almost anything. We will be using some of those, and you will realise how useful they are!\n\n#**Important information - Please read**\n\n1. While this post will cover a variety of programming topics, I highly encourage you to explore more. Go ahead and read the documentation of libraries used and think about how can you improve something in your project. I will possibly add more topics to this post.\n\n2. Please **DO NOT CREATE SPAM** by letting your bot run on all of Reddit before you have thoroughly tested it. **r\/test** exists for you to do all sorts of testing with your bot...please use it. Refer to [botiquette](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/wiki\/bottiquette) and keeping in mind the type of bot you create, comply with the guidelines.\n\n#**The code and resources**\n\nI jus wrote a bot for Reddit, which posts a textual explanation of the popular webcomic [xkcd](https:\/\/www.xkcd.com) whenever it encounters an xkcd link. It is named **explainxkcdbot**. As of now, I have set my bot to run on r\/test only to let you people test it all you want.\n\n\nYou can find the complete source code on my Github page - \n**https:\/\/github.com\/aydwi\/explainxkcdbot**\n\nHere is the code for the bot -\n**https:\/\/github.com\/aydwi\/explainxkcdbot\/blob\/master\/explainxkcdbot.py**\n\n\n#**How to run the bot**\n\nThe process is given here - https:\/\/github.com\/aydwi\/explainxkcdbot\/blob\/master\/README.md\n\nIf you have any problems in running the bot, please let me know in the comments.\n\n\n#**Let us begin**\n\nWe will move forward step-by-step in the code, and see what is going on.\n\n##Section 1 - Importing libraries\n\n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/aydwi\/e5e4f294b66adf1cb025a70a0392f847\n\n\nThis is the beginning of the program. Any line which begins with a `#` sign is a comment in Python, so it is not interpreted as code. Then we import the essential libraries required for out program. These libraries contain the methods (or functions) which we will use throughout our program. The syntax is pretty straightforward. Next we see 3 variables with some values assigned to them. More on them later.\n\n\n##Section 2 - Authenticating\n\n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/aydwi\/b941d04d8128e415d6630e961cc97988\n\n\nThis is where important things begin. Before proceeding, you should have a basic idea of what are **[classes](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/tutorial\/classes.html)** and **[methods](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/3786881\/what-is-a-method-in-python)** in Python. One more important thing is an **object** - it is an instance of class, which holds the data variables declared in class and the **member functions work on these objects**. Please make a comment if you do not understand, I will try to explain.\n\n\n`def authenticate():` defines a function which will try to authenticate the bot to Reddit. This is where PRAW comes into play as it provides us methods to do this. Remember we created a *praw.ini* file earlier. It is a configuration file that stores authentication credentials, so that you just call it whenever needed.\n\n\nNext, we pass authentication parameters to `praw.Reddit()`. Here `explainbot` refers to the credentials in the configuration file, and `user_agent` is a descriptive string about your script\/bot. This returns a [Reddit instance](https:\/\/praw.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/code_overview\/reddit_instance.html), which we assign to the variable `reddit`, and use this variable whenever we wish to authenticate.\n\n\nNext up, we make a print statement to see who is getting authenticated i.e. the name. The `user` class in PRAW provides methods for the currently authenticated user. We call the method `me()` on `user` and then call it on the variable holding the Reddit instance for authentication, which in our case is `reddit`. So the statement becomes `reddit.user.me()`. We just use some [formatting in python](https:\/\/pyformat.info\/) to print it.\n\n\nFinally we `return` the variable `reddit`. Now i can use this `authenticate()` function in my program by calling it when I need it, and it will give me the variable `reddit`, which stores the Reddit instance.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Important note 1:** Why did I create a function? It is because creating functions makes us easy to manage out code. We write separate functions for separate features of the program, and call them wherever needed. This breaks the code into manageable chunks, which makes it easy to read, modify and debug.\n\n------------------------------\n\n##Section 3 - Scraping\n\n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/aydwi\/699123424e7b38da19d62e69339e859c\n\n\nNext up is the function `def fetchdata(url)`. Notice how this function takes a parameter `url`. We pass this parameter whenever we call this function. The purpose of this function is to scrape\/gather the data from the web, in order to post an explanation.\n\n\n**Now scraping is not a very reliable process**, but sometimes we just have to do it. We go to a website, go through it's HTML source, and extract the text, links etc. that we want. Here we use **[Requests](http:\/\/docs.python-requests.org\/en\/master\/user\/quickstart\/#make-a-request)** library to make a web request, and **[Beautiful Soup](https:\/\/www.crummy.com\/software\/BeautifulSoup\/bs4\/doc\/)** to extract the data.\n\n\n`r = requests.get(url)` gives a Response object called `r`. We can get all the information we need from this object. Then we call the method `content` on `r`, and pass it to `soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')`, which gives us a `soup` object with which we can retrieve elements of a web page. Read more [here](https:\/\/www.crummy.com\/software\/BeautifulSoup\/bs4\/doc\/).\n\n\nNow what happens depends on what are you scraping. Every website has different type of content, and you should go through the HTML to see how can you retrieve what you want. In my case http:\/\/explainxkcd.com has it's explanation inside the first few `<p>` tags, so I look for the first `<p>` tag by `tag = soup.find('p')`. Also, immediately after the explanation ends, `<h2>` tag follows, so I know where to stop. Now take a look here-\n\n    while True:\n        if isinstance(tag, bs4.element.Tag):\n            if tag.name == 'h2':\n                break\n            if tag.name == 'h3':\n                tag = tag.nextSibling\n            else:\n                data = data + '\\n' + tag.text\n                tag = tag.nextSibling\n        else:\n            tag = tag.nextSibling\n\nI continue to look through the tags, and store textual data in a `string` named `data` and move to the next tag. I `break` the process if I encounter `<h2>` because I know that is where explanation ends. The code depends on the structure of website you are scraping. Finally, I return `data`, so that now when I call the function like `fetchdata('http:\/\/explainxkcd.com\/1024')` for example, it returns me the explanation of comic 1024 as a `string` named `data`.\n\n----------------\n\n**Important note 2:** Scraping is unreliable. If the website changes it's structure, you have to change your code. In this case, it can still include some tags which we don't want. The line `if (tag.name == 'h3')` in the above function is for handling one such unexpected situation I encountered on http:\/\/explainxkcd.com. This is why we like to have APIs. \n\n--------------------------\n\n\n##Section 4 - Using regular expressions, parsing URLs, handling exceptions and preventing duplicate submissions\n\n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/aydwi\/700db3e46770d13fe89356d0fa4f570d\n\n\nThis function which takes a parameter which is a Reddit instance (remember that Reddit instance from Section 1). Again we use PRAW to get one or more subreddits, and go through their comments. See [here](https:\/\/praw.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/code_overview\/reddit\/subreddits.html) and [here](http:\/\/praw.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/code_overview\/models\/comment.html).\n\nYou can pass multiple subreddits like `for comment in reddit.subreddit('test+learnprogramming+pics')`.\n\n**Regular Expressions**: Now I want to extract xkcd links from the comments, so I need to look for a pattern for the URL. xkcd links are of the form `https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/[some number]`. So we make use of regular expressions from the `re` library to match the pattern. [More about regular expressions](https:\/\/regexone.com\/references\/python).\n\n    match = re.findall(\"https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/[0-9]+\", comment.body)\n        if match:\n            print(\"Link found in comment with comment ID: \" + comment.id)\n            xkcd_url = match[0]\n\nHere I look for all strings that are like `https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/[some number]` using the method `findall` from [user comments](http:\/\/praw.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/code_overview\/models\/comment.html), and if it matches, it returns a list with the matching URL, and we store our URL in the variable `xkcd_url`.\n\n----------------\n\n**Important note 3:** Try to find out regular expressions (regex) to improve this program. What happens if a user posts 'https:\/\/xkcd.com\/1024' or http version as 'http:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/1024'. These are still valid xkcd URLs. There can be some other cases where the URL might be placed between a bunch of symbols in a comment. Try to modify the regex statement so that it can detect these cases as well.\n\n--------------------------\n\n\n**URL parsing**: Now I have an xkcd URL. I have 2 immediate objectives now- \n\nObjective 1. To extract the comic number at the end of the URL. We use [urllib.parse](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/urllib.parse.html) for this purpose.\n\n    url_obj = urlparse(xkcd_url)\n            xkcd_id = int((url_obj.path.strip(\"\/\")))\n\nObjective 2. Form a complete **explainxkcd.com** URL, which I will pass as a parameter to the function `fetchdata(url)` (See Section 2)\n\n    myurl = 'http:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/' + str(xkcd_id)\n\nBoth objectives are thus complete.\n\n**Preventing duplicate submissions and Exception handling**: The bot needs to make sure it replies to every comment only once. There are many methods you can try which include using a separate key-value database like [Memcached](https:\/\/memcached.org\/), but we will use a simpler approach.\n\n\nJust create a text file (remember commented.txt), store the comment ID of a comment in it when you  visit a relevant comment, and verify if a comment ID already exists in that file before making new comments. Remember to put the location of the text file in the `path` variable (from Section 1), so that you can pass it to the method `open()`.\n\n\nNow, what happens when a user makes a comment like 'https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/689243348723'. This xkcd does not exist, but the program will extract '689243348723', then form a link like http:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/689243348723, and pass it to the function `fetchdata(url)`. Now **the function will return an exception and your program will stop\/crash**. You need to take care of these situations.\n\nThis is achieved using `try`, `except` and `else` blocks. [See here](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/tutorial\/errors.html) Here is the code for these 2 steps-\n\n    file_obj_r = open(path,'r')\n                        \n            try:\n                explanation = fetchdata(myurl)\n            except:\n                print('Exception!!! Possibly incorrect xkcd URL...\\n')\n                # Typical cause for this will be a URL for an xkcd that does not exist (Example: https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/772524318\/)\n            else:\n                if comment.id not in file_obj_r.read().splitlines():\n                    print('Link is unique...posting explanation\\n')\n                    comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)\n                    \n                    file_obj_r.close()\n\n                    file_obj_w = open(path,'a+')\n                    file_obj_w.write(comment.id + '\\n')\n                    file_obj_w.close()\n                else:\n                    print('Already visited link...No reply needed\\n')\n\n\nNotice how I make a reply to a relevant comment by using the variables from Section 1 to print header and footer description alongside the explanation - `comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)`\n\n\nNext we make some `sleep` statements to stop the bot from querying Reddit too fast. If the Reddit API returns an error due to too many requests, adjust `val` in the instances of `time.sleep(val)` in your program.\n\n\n##Section 5: The main function\n\n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/aydwi\/99323ebd710428f4590077a844236f83\n\n\nWe are almost done here. We wrap our functions into a `main` function by calling `authenticate()` (remember Section 1) and passing it to the function which runs the bot, namely `run_explainbot(reddit)`. Since we are calling it inside `while` loop with the expression 'True', it will run indefinitely.\n\n\n#My bot in action\n\n\nTest post to show the bot in action: https:\/\/redd.it\/6tey71 (Since I'm not running it continuously as of now, it won't reply to every comment containing an xkcd link there)\n\nMy Terminal emulator while running the bot: http:\/\/imgur.com\/4TzEyor\n\n\n**Finally, if you want to take this project further, you are welcome to contribute code to [my Github repository](https:\/\/github.com\/aydwi\/explainxkcdbot). You can fork it (please note that there are still some checks to be added in order to make the bot more Reddit friendly) or open a pull request.** I'll try to add more details about file handling and scraping aspects of the program once I get some time. \n",

I've also linked to the Eagle design files on [Github,](https:\/\/github.com\/w3woody\/TransistorCircuits ) in case anyone is interested.\n\nSo question: if I actually build a working 8-bit computer from 2N3904 transistors--is this something folks would be interested in looking at, for educational purposes? I mean, I seem to be headed down this path (I've ordered circuits for an accumulator register and general purpose registers, and I'm now designing the glue hardware for the flag register)--but once it's done, uh, does it make a useful educational tool?",

All undergraduate departments and courses from the Fall and Spring semesters of 2018-2019 should be included.\n\nThere are no paywalls, just a simple design: choose a department (and optionally a course number), and click on the desired course.\n\nThere were quite a few challenges in making this website, from getting the data from CSU Fullerton to dealing with the sheer amount of data, but all in all I think it could serve as a very useful resource in determining which classes to enroll in and with what instructor, especially for those weed-out classes and for pre-med folks.\n\nLet me know what you think, and contact me if you find any issues - thanks!",

   "description":"So I'm a junior who recently transferred to a school with a well-respected computer science program. Now that I'm somewhere with a bit more recognition and more advanced computer classes, I'm starting to apply for summer internships. However, I'm *absolutely* terrified and feel like I'm not cut out for any of them! :( I lost a bunch of credits when I transferred and will be doing an extra semester most likely, so I'm planning on applying to local internships for this summer and more prestigious  internships for next... But even the local internships scare me lol\n\nI've done well in all of my comp sci classes so far (although one or two of the prereqs like physics, etc were roooough), and up until this semester I *thought* I had amassed a decent amount of experience programming my own neopets-esque site in middle school\/high school. \n\nBut also, as I've advanced to upper level classes I've started to realize how much I *don't* know + how much my code sucked then\/sucks now, and it's mildly terrifying lol. And so the idea of actually working in computer science terrifies me, to the point where I've debated not working in programming despite the fact that it's something I'm obviously interested in :\/ I'd like to think a lot of it is because I'm a woman in STEM, but at least 45% of my school's comp sci department is female so eh lol \n\nDid anyone else feel the same way or is currently feeling the same way? Any words of encouragement? :(\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I think I am decent at programming. I have programmed before attending university and I also do my fair bit of study outside of university. However, for this final assessment is big compared to the others. I do not have much experience dealing with trying to understand lots of code which has already been written. I know understanding pre-written code is a very important skill as you barely write code from scratch in the real world. For this reason, I am a little scared that maybe software is not for me? Is this a skill no one has at the start? How do I improve on it?",

   "description":"My undergrad is in engineering, and started out in manufacturing before discovering that my real love was programming.\n\n\n1) I realized many departments that are very dependent on computer science (I actually work in analytics, not software development), are just full of people with no formal training on it.  They will write awful code and have no idea why it runs so poorly.  I seem to have a knack for cleaning it up, but it feels strange to always be advising people on something I have no formal training on.\n\n\n2) Yes, you can google the answer to anything, but you don't know what you don't know.  And a teacher will force you to study the boring parts that many self taught people overlook.  I have coworkers who desperately need to learn the low level differences between integer and character variables; and don't know how big of a gap this is in their practical knowledge.\n\n\n3) I've been exposed to some communities of self taught programmers who will brag about things they built in python like they think it's brand new computer science, while obviously having no idea if they built the Taj Mahal or a child's pillow fort.  I'm NOT here to bash python, this is just to show a pitfall of pure self taught knowledge.\n\n\n4) I actually like theory!  I love math (was close to finishing an undergrad in math) and was considering pursuing an advanced degree in math, but my favorite kind of mathematics is all around computer science, so thought a comp sci degree would be a better option while also being more relevant to the jobs I want.\n\n\nFinally, I wanted to say that I love my program so far!  I've already learned a lot of the \"boring but important\" things I was previously missing.",

I generally just tinker around keeping the basics fresh, but recently I had an opportunity to speed up some data analysis at work, and was able to use python to do it!\n\nAs part of our testing, we generate some large csv files (generally 1-4 gb), which were a real pain in the ass to work with in excel. Using python and pandas, I wrote a short piece of code (200 lines) to parse our data, strip out the junk, and plot it into a presentable form. Now there are like 5 people using it on a regular basis!\n\nThis is a big deal for me so I wanted to share it. Even dumb mech e\u2019s can use computers!\n\nE: Wow! Thanks for the overwhelming support guys! Every single comment I saw was very positive and helpful, you all are awesome. ",

I feel burned out from my courses, internships, and student jobs in the past 2 years and have no motivation to do anything related to CS at the moment. I feel as if all my inspiration and energy have been sucked out of me.\n\nI have a paid offer to do my thesis at a research institute in my city, but I am inclined to decline the offer due to lack of interest and mental exhaustion. I am also more interested in NLP, which is unavailable at my university. Since I live in a small city, there are not many opportunities for a paid thesis and I am afraid that I would be making a mistake turning down the offer. I am also scared to move to another city for my thesis due to a negative experience earlier this year.\n\nI feel as if I want to give up and I feel so lost. Any advice would be appreciated.",

   "description":"I'm not super experienced in Python \\-\\- my main programming language is Java, but I learned Python from a CS course I took last semester.  I love programming, but I also really love hip hop music.  I typically find this music by looking at a website called Hot New Hip Hop, which keeps a list of the top 100 new songs at any given time.  There are a select number of artists who I like, and a lot of the time the tracks are too new to be on Spotify.\n\nTo save myself time, I automated my process of searching for and discovering new music.  I used Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a script to run every morning, scrape the top 100 songs page, and add songs to a playlist if they're made by artists I like and are on Spotify.  I also used a SQLite database to store my Spotify client and access tokens, as well as prevent adding duplicate songs.  This script will probably save me about 45 minutes to an hour each week, which is pretty sweet.  You can check it out on Github here: [https:\/\/github.com\/mileshenrichs\/spotify\\-playlist\\-generator](https:\/\/github.com\/mileshenrichs\/spotify-playlist-generator)",

   "description":"Started learning C++ around 7 months ago. I was full of enthusiasm which helped me through a difficult term. For the most part, I did well but there were times I hit brick walls that wouldn\u2019t budge for weeks.\n\nI started my 2nd term studying C++ the beginning of January and felt like I was having my ass handed to me everyday. I honestly didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to do what was being asked of me.\n\nThen things clicked. Not by magic but with lots of trial and error, coding in my free time, and really diving into the material. Now I might run into a small problem that makes makes me scratch my head but I generally know how to approach things. And I\u2019m writing programs faster than I could ever imagine which is nice for my sanity.\n\nSo I just wanted to share this update because a. I posted a whiny vent session in January and b. to encourage anyone struggling with a language.\n\nAdvice: \nCoding is like math where you get better by doing it. Do your assignments and if there\u2019s time, work on small projects of your own. I use my own assignments (after turning it in of course) to play with and personalize.\n\nI started writing tutorials which forces me to revisit material from the beginning. Find a free app and work through the problems even if it feels silly studying what you already know. I find myself not having to look up every little thing because I\u2019m always refreshing my memory (no pun intended).\n\nThe thing that helps me most is talking through my problems. Get a rubber duck if you need to, pretend you\u2019re teaching a class - verbalizing what\u2019s going on and what you\u2019re trying to achieve works wonders! And take a nap. Sometimes the best thing you can do is see a problem with fresh eyes.\n\nAlright that was more than a few words. I have some time to kill on the bus. :)",

   "description":"(This is going to be enlightening to some and very brutal to others. I dont apologize for anything as this is reality.)\n\nEdit 2: will be away for a bit bit will return to answer questions later. TLDR: To me, CS is a beautiful art. The blend of CS and Math and other disciplines makes it imo one of the best skillset to have! I hate seeing the new javashit.js bloated pushed around so much and not enough promo is being made for CS. Keep CS beautiful!\n\nPLEASE DO YOUR MATH AND STATS! This is the best advice i can give anyone out there! I see many questions on here about how relevant is calculus and linear algebra in the workplace. Let me answer that with a simple statement: You can work for me or you can work with me.\n\nIve hired quite a few people that went to some school for Web Programming\/Angular.js\/blablabla framework bootcamp\/shortcourse and yes ive hired them for the going rate of what a web developer but the problem is they remain right there, with no chance of moving up. Ive heard all the complaints about \"Not progressing, not going up, not being given enough opportunities to do more serious stuff...\" All they end up doing is converting excel spreadsheets into databases and make front end forms to fill the data.\n\nCS is definitely not programming - get that out of your head! At some point, every business\/workplace has some challenges that need those special CS skills to solve. And people with CS are very hard to find usually only 2-3&#37; of the resumes i go through have proper CS in them.\n\nAt my previous job I was work in metal mining and I had hired a CS kid for his co-op term and he didnt even know half of the programming languages out there but he said he was OK with Python. What was really impressive was his background in computer vision, algorithms, linear algebra, calculus etc. We had to de-water a lake up north in the north west territories and we had to estimate the number of fish in that lake that would be afected to report back to the RCMP, the local government, fisheries etc.\n\nWe brought in \"experts\" and nobody seemed to offer a good solution. This kid and I were going to work together on this project. You can imagine the massive backlash from our web developers. They tore me a new asshole, they brought the fury of the god of war on me. But my superiors knew the reason i chose this kid over our existing developers - they did not have the skills needed for this task and we are not a college that can teach them these skills. We tried to explain to them that they need a different set of skills for different tasks, we've even offered them paid training on some topics to get them started however they declined because of the math prep work needed. Unfortunately you need that 4 years of college education for that and we as a company cannot do such a thing. So naturally the developers hated him, excluded him out of their inner circle, would crack jokes at how he didnt know MVC and made fun of him when he was using python.\n\nSo we developed an underwater camera system using a few cameras placed in some spots in the lake. Kid wrote an algorithm that could identify fish in the video frames and he used his statistical knowledge and gave us a good solution on how to estimate the population of fish in that lake. We then spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to catch each fish and tag them so they could be transferred to another lake. His estimate was about 94&#37; of the total fish we caught, a very impressive number! After that, all the other developers calmed their rage and they knew there was a clear distinction between them and this kid. This kid didnt know shit about MVC or angular or node and shit but he had what we really needed for us to get our environment permitting completed!\n\nWe worked on a few other interesting math-inspired projects until he got caught up by some oil company who was really impressed with the work he did for us and their office was close to where his parents lived so he relocated to the US.\n\nSo please, do your math! Ive been through calc and i hated it, but i pressed my nose and just went for it. I even went for the full specialist option in CS, it sucked balls, my life was spent in books and tears. I didnt really know what I was going to do in life and where I was going with all this math but I am so glad i did it even though i didnt get all A's in them lol. It does really pay off especially statistics which will open up a huge array of opportunities. Take up every opportunity you can: teachers office hours, TAs, workshops and anything you can. Math is not hard, youre just doing it wrong. People who are good in math are good at it because they figured out how to elarn math. Take the time and figure that out. My reason was simply i was overthingking math and that was making me panic often. Do it, because that math and stats skill will make you shine exponentially brighter during interviews! Ive known people at other companies offer a bonus cheque and RSU options if their CS candidate would take the offer.\n\n\\###Do not underestimate CS!\n\nCouple of other things i see on here and I can help answer:\n\n\\##Do grades and GPA matter?\n\nNo not really, unless we have doubts during the interview then we would want to see how you perform academically maybe youre just the type of person shy in interviews but when left alone you can do the job or at least be able to do the research needed to get the job done. However some companies put in a minimum GPA which i think is stupid as it shows they dont really know what they are hiring so they use the GPA system as an indicator when hiring people - watch out for these companies! Unless they are intern\/co-op positions which will use GPA as method of filtering out thousands of applications.\n\n\\##What programming languages to learn?\n\nShouldnt matter. The programming language used varies from company to company and if you are real CS, you shouldnt worry about that because the monkey coding is usually offshored or sent to contractors\/consulting companies. We want to hire you to solve our problems and usually that just requires paper and you can prorotype in python or anyting and nobody would care.\n\n\\##Unix or windows?\n\nAgain for a CS position we dont care. Leave that to the monkey coders to figure out\n\n\\##How much math do you use everyday?\n\nQuite a bit! I recently developed an algorithm that categorizes hazard and risk levels of contaminants (Arsenic, Asbestos, Beryllium etc) for underground workers in mines\/excavation sites\/drill rigs etc and it is almost purely based on statistics. That lower and upper confidence limits and the markov model do come in very handy!\n\n\\##Do you use proofs at work?\n\nThis is going to be probably one of the biggest points ive ever made. I hated proofs, i hated proving that fucking epsilon lies between whatever... I hated induction.. HOWEVER when i was first hired for my previous job as a CS kid, i had immediate and fierce reception from older self taught employees who have been \"programming\" for 10 years in their basements and were eyeing my position. I didnt understand until years later. Whenever i would create something, a simple algorithm for something, they would attack it and say they can do better or faster. This is where your proofs come in and you can also prove that their solution is faulty. This is where runtime algorithms and other proofing techniques (fucking induction) come in useful - you can PROVE that your solution works and if theirs is better, then they have to prove it using the same notation and technique - because this is what is required when you write published papers. The moment they see the Big-O notation is the moment they will scurry away and say \"sorry were too busy, go ahead with your project\"\n\nBecause that proof is your defence and your CS degree is the biggest supporter of your claim. That is the fastest way to make your boss feel safe in hiring you for the job. Your boss might not (and shouldnt necessarily) know shit about CS but with that proof document, they can use that to defend you and use that for auditing purposes etc.\n\n\\##Can i use university lectures from course era and other online resources?\n\nYes by all means do it. You can even get certifications for these online courses and they are definitely better than those angular bootcamps. If i asked you to explain the normal distribution and how it can be used, then we're talking!\n\n\\##Do i need the certifications from these online courses?\n\nYes. Let me explain why, if I were to give you a task that would affect the health and safety of people, environment etc, then you need to have that certification because if my ass gets audited one day, that cert will show that you are certified by an issuing authority (the college) that you know this field and you know what you are doing.\n\nAMA\n\nedit: typos",

   "description":"Hello!\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some advice from fellow computer scientists. I have completed my undergraduate degree (4 years) in Computer Science. Although I love my field and was planning to go into web development, many things got in the way of finding a job right after graduation. (Mostly mental and physical health, and working in a part-time job just to save some money)\n\nI'm curious what the best way would be to go about re-learning coding and concepts. I haven't touched anything in maybe under a year. I do not think all hope is lost as I still remember a lot of ideas and I doubt I have forgotten everything, but I do not think I can just jump back into job hunting right away.\n\nAnother question is, how would I approach an interviewer later on, if they ask me why I have not been active in coding for a year? I'm hoping to do as many projects as I can before getting an interview, but I worry that they will look at my timeline on my resume and maybe inquire.\n\nThank you in advance!",

Such as the Libre Office, which is basically free editing software. \n\n[This](https:\/\/www.thesimpledollar.com\/60-awesome-student-discounts-on-clothes-tech-travel-and-more\/) is a link to a news article that has a list of companies that will give out discounts for students through a .edu account or a student id.\n\n[This](https:\/\/www.humblebundle.com\/) is humble bundle. Which will bundle up videog games, and the occasional books and software. The earnings for this goes to multiple charities. \n\n[This](https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/) is my favorite website to search for recipes. I love using this website because it has some pretty good (and often) cheap recipes to work with.\n\nHope you enjoy looking through these links. Please post any that you don't see in here. ",

The reason I ask is because I've heard from a seasoned dev at work that he still keeps his last companies work\/code\/projects \"should he have to reference them to help\". Don't really know if that's a thing or not.\n\nEDIT: This thread is either \"NO NO NO!\" or \"I have every piece of code I've ever written...\" -- I think I'm going to ask.

She\u2019s so desperate to not have an online final that I feel like she\u2019s totally disadvantaged our class and taken away study time that I was really depending on. Is she even allowed to do this?!?\n\nEdit: she also hasn\u2019t posted the study guide and the exam is literally this Tuesday.. pray for me y\u2019all.\n\nEdit 2: I did contact dean of students so fingers crossed that they will fix this mess...

I feel like personally, the more I learn the less I know because each new topic I learn just opens me up to a completely new level of complexity. Furthermore, no matter how deeply you go into one component there is an entire science just behind how electricity moves throughout that component.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike for example, even if you understood the in's and out's of a bus (which in and of itself is a very complex topic) you still have so many other equally components that the buses interact with. Even at a molecular level so much happens just to display text on the screen and it's fascinating and it makes me want to know everything that goes on behind the scenes but how much would it take to actually understand it all of it at a fundamental level?

   "description":"Hi all :) I'm happy to share with you the result of this project, it certainly has been a lot of fun! I announced it on reddit previously... and here it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all it was shocking how many messages we had over such a long time... and it was very interesting to see the patterns occuring.\n\nNext, I trained a bot for several nights (+ experimentation) that in the end does pretty well!\n\nFrom the video you can see that it doesn't take the \"current time\" into account, which actually turned out to be its biggest flaw, lol (no spoilers)!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, writing the \"facebook driver\" with selenium was fun too.\n\nWhat turned out to be an interesting part of the model is that it had to split up a message into more messages (there's a difference between a newline and a new bubble), which I represented as a special character in my data.\n\nThe other way too - I had to make sure it did not reply to every message individually, but instead I had it wait some time. It was considering messages starting with a capital letter as \"mobile\" (and allow a longer wait than non-mobile).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/nzXt471bXmA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/nzXt471bXmA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you like it, please follow me on github [https:\/\/github.com\/kootenpv](https:\/\/github.com\/kootenpv)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately the code is too sloppy to post on my github right now but in case you'd be interested I should maybe clean it and put it there.\n\nOr perhaps just the facebook driver I wrote?",

I have a few years of coding experience but zero idea of how to go about this or even if it's possible. Any advice?\n\nJust a note: I'm not actually skipping class.

   "description":"https:\/\/inventwithpython.com\/automateudemy (This link will automatically redirect you to the latest discount code.)\n\n[(EDIT: The HTML book is free online, but you can get the PDF\/Kindle ebook of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python in this week's Humble Bundle in support of cornavirus relief (Direct Relief, International Rescue Committee, Doctors Without Borders, Partners In Health)](https:\/\/www.humblebundle.com\/conquer-covid19-bundle)\n\nYou can also click this link or manually enter the code: APR2020FREE (on Saturday the code changes to APR2020FREE2)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.udemy.com\/course\/automate\/?couponCode=APR2020FREE\n\nThis promo code works until April 7th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes 30 minutes or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later.\n\nUdemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.\n\nYou can also purchase the course at a discount using my code APR2020 or MAY2020 (or whatever month\/year it is) or clicking https:\/\/inventwithpython.com\/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code. I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $14 to $16. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, which means I don't get the credit for referral signups. Blerg.)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\n* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.\n* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.\n* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https:\/\/inventwithpython.com\n* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https:\/\/automatetheboringstuff.com\/2e\/\n* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.\n* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.\n* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https:\/\/inventwithpython.com\/blog\/2019\/10\/07\/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python\/)\n* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be \"good at math\" to be good at coding.**\n* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get\/stay motivated.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/learnprogramming\/wiki\/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a \"gym buddy\" to learn with.",

Recently I started toying around with Go to branch out into more easily redistributable software, WebAssembly, and mobile app development. I started by trying to port over some existing Python scripts.\n\nWhat quickly became apparent is exactly how much time and code Requests has saved me over the years. The session management is so stupidly plug-and-play simple. That's not to say the Go http package is bad, Requests is just really, *really* convenient, powerful, and well-organized.\n\nSo cheers to the maintainers of Requests. It's by far the thing I miss most while I'm learning Go.",

The corpus has data on papers' citation network, so we trained word2vec on those networks. We then used these citation embeddings as a label for the output of Bert, the input being the abstract for that paper. \n\nThis is an inference colab notebook\n\nhttps:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/github\/Santosh-Gupta\/NaturalLanguageRecommendations\/blob\/master\/notebooks\/inference\/DemoNaturalLanguageRecommendationsCPU_Autofeedback.ipynb#scrollTo=wc3PMILi2LN6\n\nwhich automatically and anonymously records queries, that we'll just to test future versions of our model against. If you do not want to provide feedback automatically, here's a version where feedback can only be send manually:\n\nhttps:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/github\/Santosh-Gupta\/NaturalLanguageRecommendations\/blob\/master\/notebooks\/inference\/DemoNaturalLanguageRecommendationsCPU_Manualfeedback.ipynb\n\nWe are in the middle of developing much more improved versions of our model; more accurate models which contain more papers (we accidentally filtered a bunch of important CS papers in the first version), but we had to submit our initial project for a Tensorflow Hackathon, so we decided to do an initial pre-release, and use the opportunity to perhaps collect some user data in further qualitative analysis of our models. Here is our hackathon submission:\n\nhttps:\/\/devpost.com\/software\/naturallanguagerecommendations\n\n----\n\nAs a sidequest, we also build a TPU-based vector similarity search library. We are eventually going to be dealing with 9 figures of paper embeddings of size 512 or 256. TPUs have a ton of memory, and are very fast, so it might be helpful when dealing with a ton of vectors. \n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/1LVlz34.png\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/srihari-humbarwadi\/tpu_index\n\n-----\n\nStuff we used: Keras \/ Tensorflow 2.0, TPUs, SciBert, HuggingFace, Semantic Scholar. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.",

   "description":"Hello, like the title says I want an introductory book on Computer Architecture. I already have Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach but that seems very high level. I was originally going to buy Hennessy and Patterson's Computer Organization and Design but some reviews are scaring me off from that. I am looking at Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi, but I am worried that it focuses too much on embedded systems. I want something more general and Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi's reviews sometimes make it seem like it covers Computer Architecture in the general sense.\n\nSo here's the criteria that I want:\n1. The book should assume little knowledge of Computer Architecture\n2. I learn best when I experiment so being a little interactive would be a plus\n3. I want it to touch on some higher level topics like pipelining, branch predictions, machine code, cache, and possibly multicore processors\n\nThank you so much and I welcome any suggestions, or people who used Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi, does this book cover most of what I want?",

   "description":"(Sorry for the throwaway, but I wanted to be able to answer questions honestly without any hesitation.)\n\nI've been in IT since I was 17 in 1999. I started off at a help desk, and worked my way up to a Systems Administrator where I was making 60k USD\/yr. (I currently have only an associates degree with no plans to go back to school.) I was primarily a Windows domain\/ network admin, with a few *nix boxes spread throughout. I had known windows batch scripting, and way back in the day had programmed in BASIC before the world was.\n\n\nI had tossed around the idea of learning a programming language before, but when asked I'd often say \"Developers' brains just work differently than mine. I'm not a coder.\" Programming seemed so abstract and I couldn't really wrap my head around it.  I finally decided though, to try something.\n\nIt was 2010 and I had heard a lot of Ruby on Rails and thought that Ruby would be a great language to learn. I ran through the tutorial of making a polls app at least 5 times, but I just couldn't wrap my head around it. So I gave up.\n\n\nOne year later I heard about python. Despite all the negative talk about python while googling for \"python vs ruby vs php vs ...\" *(GIL, speed, whitespace, duck typing, (not that I knew what ANY of that meant anyway))* I decided that I really wanted to give it a shot. I started out with codeacademy to get my feet wet, I'd tinker with idle while my wife and I would watch netflix after the kids went to bed. Then I started dreaming in code.\n\nHave you ever had \"work dreams\"? The kind you have for about 2 weeks after starting a new job that's really hard? That was python for me. Being primarily in a Windows environment it was hard to find anything for python to do initially at work. My boss didn't program, and really didn't see the value in it. Then one day I found myself needing to compare a list of files. I needed to find all the files that were in one column but not in the other. I had them in excel and after working through a formula I had my answer, but I hated it. All I wanted to do was write something like--\n\n    select name from column1 where name not in (select name from column2);\n    \nEnter python and sqlite. It probably took me about 3 hours to figure it out, but I imported a csv into a sqlite table in python so I could query it. BAM! I was hooked from then on.\n\nEvery night I would tinker, read, and play. I found tons of things to automate at work, making my time so much more effective. I loved it. I became a python evangelist. I'd like to say that my boss was impressed, but really he never came around, and it frustrated me. Fast forward a year.\n\nI had heard about the DevOps movement and though I didn't understand it completely at the time I thought that being a Developer and Systems Admin mutant sounded like a lot of fun, and something I could really be good at. \n\nAfter having a rough time with my boss one day I decided to check the local classifieds. I saw an ad for a DevOps Admin. Basically this guy needed to know hardware, networking, provisioning, something called puppet, and one of three scripting languages- ruby, bash, or python. \n\nI looked at puppet, and after having learned about booleans and strings and syntax from python, picking it up wasn't a problem. I got hired on the spot for $90k USD. A clean 50% raise. I use python every single day. I write scripts to check if databases back up properly, if services are up, if all 1000 of my physical servers are getting their updates, to provision RAIDs, you name it. I integrate what I write into puppet, fabric, and a host of other tools that I've learned along the way.\n\nAfter doing that for a little over a year now, I'm about to hire 2 guys under me as we expand and I'm moving up to $120k USD. I'm learning django for fun and am just starting into machine learning. I check out \/r\/python every day, you guys have been so helpful to me along my way. And if I can learn python, anybody can!!!\n\nTL;DR\nI learned python in a year and got a 50% raise. 1 year later I got another 25% raise, all from python!\n\nedit: percentages, oh math...\n\n\n\n\n",

However, I am now looking to expand this to other languages besides python, add smarter Stack Overflow queries, and even create VS Code and Atom extensions.\n\nLiterally anyone interested in this project can start making changes and submitting pull requests. After a few contributions, if you'd like to become a collaborator, that's a possibility too! Not to mention that this project is definitely beginner friendly!\n\nCheckout the repo at [https:\/\/github.com\/autostack-team\/autostack](https:\/\/github.com\/autostack-team\/autostack)!

   "description":"Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to make this post in regards to an \"exploitation\" email I just received. If y'all see an email that threatens to \"expose\" you for watching sexual content unless you pay a sum of money, don't fall for it! These kinds of emails are usually poor in grammar, claim that they \"saw\" you do this on some month in the future, and usually prey on our mental states of shame and what not so that we would comply.\n\nI just spoke to IT about this, and the best thing you can do here is changing the password to your portal. Unfortunately, there's no two-factor authentication or anything like that so just generate some complicated password using \"Lastpass\" or any other password generating website. \n\nJust passing the word along, in case anyone else also happens to receive that email.",

I feel like that would be possible and it would involve a machine learning tool where it can create instruction sets out of somebody's data to reproduce it elsewhere without actually sending the file across the internet.\n\n\nJust a late night thought..\n\nEdit: I didn't think this post was going to get much attention I enjoyed reading everybody's comments thank you all :D",

(For example, I know with bucket sort, it's mainly useful when values are uniformly distributed. I'm wondering if cubesort has some sort of limitation.)",

   "description":"Hey everyone. Posted in December with free textbooks for computer science and math courses so i'm posting the link again. I have books for linear, OS, Python, C++, Computer Networking, Engineering Economics, Ethics, Calculus Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Discrete Math, Java and more. Check it out download what you need and save yourself a few bucks. A lot of professors don't care if you use older version textbooks either. Don't be shy pass it on to your friends or classmates and save them some money too. For anyone else that needs other books too check out the website [*libgen.io*](https:\/\/libgen.io) it's where I find the majority of my books. Search by isbn or author or name of textbook whichever way finds the book possibly for you. Another way i've found success too is doing a google search in this format \"ENTER BOOK TITLE NAME HERE <PDF>\". Anyway here is the link to the textbooks [https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1dDB\\_jDtW0i5CHdMWBpFIurHuG3A4WDE8](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1dDB_jDtW0i5CHdMWBpFIurHuG3A4WDE8) . Also I want to give a special shoutout to \/u\/foohydude5 he hangs around this sub all the time and I just want to say you're a wanna be pretentious asshole who belongs in r\/iamverysmart keep it up man :-) something something Titans reach higher",

   "community_name":"Python",
   "url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Python\/comments\/8wc2vi\/5_rarely_mentioned_but_super_useful_packages_you\/",
   "description":"I feel like there are a lot of packages out there that are incredibly useful, but often get overlooked for one reason or another. It seems like people spend a lot of time re-implementing something that's already been done pretty well, and that's too bad. Because, using a nice package with a slick api is like taking a breath of crisp morning mountain air.\n\nSo here's some packages I love that I think folks should know about and take a look for themselves:\n\n[Inflection](http:\/\/inflection.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/): Inflection is ridiculously useful. It has all kinds of tools for altering strings into different formats. Think, conversion from CamelCase to snake\\_case. Or, even ordinalizing numbers (1 -> 'first'). Pluralization is in there too. It's really handy with lots of features. I've used it for a few years now without any problems and a whole lot of fresh air in my life.\n\n[Pendulum](https:\/\/pendulum.eustace.io\/): Python's datetime library is....well, painful to use. It has most everything you need, but doing what you want might be a whole afternoon of consternation. I used a few date\/time libraries before I stumbled onto Pendulum. This library is really great. Not only does it offer a great parser that you rarely have to provide anything more than a string representation of a datetime, but it has lots of really useful utilities for working with dates and times (and both). Finally, the best part is that it's a \\_drop-in\\_ replacement! In fact, Pendulum DateTime objects inherit from python's native DateTime, so you can almost always use them anywhere you would use normal DateTime. This one has been a favorite for a long time.\n\n[pprintpp](https:\/\/github.com\/wolever\/pprintpp): Python's native pretty-printer often renders stuff that's...well, not pretty at all. I often deal with a lot of deeply nested native data-structures (basically JSON rendered into python), and when I'm debugging python's pretty-printer feels pretty stuffy. Enter pprintpp. It's a drop-in replacement that can monkey-patch the built-in pprint function. At any rate, my deeply-nested dicts are formatted with a whole lot more readability in my logs with this package\n\n[Snakeviz](https:\/\/jiffyclub.github.io\/snakeviz\/): Profiling performance becomes a pretty necessary task in most python projects with any degree of longevity. However, exploring profile dumps can be a super stuffy experience a lot of times. I've suffered through enough non-intuitive files and interfaces trying to dig down to the cause of slowness in my lifetime. Then, I found Snakeviz. It provides a really intuitive, interactive, in-browser way to explore profiling information. This tool has actually made profiling fun and exciting, and I can't recommend it enough.\n\n[Livereload](https:\/\/github.com\/lepture\/python-livereload): Suppose you're doing something like, say, working on your project's documentation. It's really not fun to, after each tweak of your config or doc files, have to manually run the sphinx-build commands and then open the produced html in a browser. Instead, you might try Livereload. You provide a list of files to watch, run it, and open a browser. Then, any time you change the file, your page will automatically reload. It's a core element of one of my personal projects (sphinx-view...and this doesn't count as my plug), and without it things would be a lot more painful. It can also be used for any number of other situations where html is produced from source files. It's pretty easy to use, too, and soo crisp and cool when you see it in action.\n\nFinally...my plug:\n\n[py-buzz](https:\/\/github.com\/dusktreader\/py-buzz): \"That's not flying, it's falling with style.\" Honestly...I have way too much fun with the name. The whole point of this package is that I found myself re-writing the same pattern over and over with custom exceptions. Typically, when I'm writing a new library, I end up with a custom exception base-class that I use (along with derived exceptions) throughout the project. Then, I end up doing the same thing over and over. Well, I took that irritation and turned it into a tool. The handiest parts of this package is the \\`Buzz.require\\_condition\\` function that acts like an assert that isn't disabled in production and \\`Buzz.handle\\_errors\\` which gives you a context manager to handle exceptions within a block. I dog-food the hell out of this package, so it should be in great working order. There's other neat features, but I'll let you read up yourself, if you're interested.\n\nIf not, please enjoy learning about the other 5 packages above.\n\nAnd, please remember, if you find yourself dealing with something annoying: Stop. Google the problem. Find a package that already does it. Install that. Breathe the fresh mountain air.",

   "description":"At school, we are just presented each individual topics\/subjects. Often times, for each of these individual topics, there is no concrete overview of all the sub-topics involved. This makes fully understanding the topic and the overall field harder. \nTo me, when learning a new topic, it is a good idea to first have an pictorial overview of it, and then in the process of understanding the detail, keep referring back to the picture. At the end of the learning process, zoom out, and link all the related parts together.\n(Like solving photo puzzles, we assemble all the parts into the frame at the end.)\n\nAn example of such picture will be similar to the following (inside the linux kernel): \nhttp:\/\/turnoff.us\/geek\/inside-the-linux-kernel\/\nThis picture is not the best to express what I mean, but it has the general idea there. \nThink of each object as a node (or topic\/subtopics), and there are lines connecting the nodes. (The lines denote relationships between nodes.)\nAnother example would be something similar to those \"Javascript in one picture\" kind of pictures.\nSince I have yet seen any pictures that I look for, I do not know how to concretely express it.. (maybe I can do better after a good night a sleep).\n\nIn any case, if any of you know of any similar pictures, please let me know. Or if there's no such picture exist, I would like people who is knowledgeable enough in the field to make such pictures. It will surely help not just the newcomers but also some of those who are already familiar with the general topology of the field.\nI would like to use these kind of pictures to help others in their learning.\n(If you have\/know of pictures for other disciplines please let me know as well!)\n\nThank you very much in advance. Good night.\n\n- M",

   "description":"**tl;dr**\n\nAn open source, free,  python personal assistant with a user expandable plugin framework and nlp from spaCy.io.\n\n* Sign up: http:\/\/willbeddow.com\/signup\n* Web app: http:\/\/willbeddow.com \n* Github: https:\/\/github.com\/ironman5366\/W.I.L.L\n* Android app: https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.willbeddow.will\n* Telegram interface: @WillAssistantBot on telegram\n\n**Details**:\n\nA while back, [I posted a video](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Python\/comments\/47jdxi\/my_open_source_python_personal_assistant\/) of my personal assistant - W.I.L.L. It was my first major project, and you guys gave me alot of tips and comments on what you liked, how I could improve, and the right way to do some open source stuff that I hadn't previously encountered.\n\nAfter **a lot** of rewrites, extensive work (by both me, and the W.I.L.L community), I'm happy to present W.I.L.L version 3.0.\n\n**What can W.I.L.L do?**\n\nOne of my major goals with W.I.L.L was not only to make a cool concept for a personal assistant, but to make it usable and useful. W.I.L.L. already has a number of useful plugins, and it's super easy to add more. \n\n**Plugins W.I.L.L already has:**\n\n* News: ex: \"read me the news\" - a summary of the news from a site of your choice, refreshed every twelve hours\n* Weather: ex: \"What's the weather like?\" - weather for your location, delivered using PyOwm\n* Spotify: ex: \"Play jukebox hero on spotify\" - Searches spotify and opens a spotify url for the song that's found. On android, will open in the spotify app\n* Netflix: ex: \"Watch Futurama on netflix\" - searches netflix and opens a netflix url for the shwo that's found. On android, will open in the netflix app\n* Reminders: ex: \"Remind me in 10 minutes about how awesome W.I.L.L is\" - sets reminders. You can currently be notified via email and socket.io push notifications on the web app, and thanks to the expandable notification framework, it's easy to add new methods of notifying the user.\n* **Search**: The crown jewel of the plugins, set to run by default when no other plugin is triggered by the input. Search runs through a chain of different search engines and sites to find the correct answer of a question. It first searches wolframalpha and wikipedia, and if it can't find anything it uses nlp from the newspaper module and bs4 to parse a correct answer from the top google result.\n\n**Just how easy is it to add a plugin?**\n\n    from core.plugin_handler import subscribe\n    def run_check(event):\n        #Check for a word in the provided spacy nlp object\n        return \"example\" in [i.orth_ for i in event[\"doc\"]]\n    \n    @subscribe({\"name\":\"example\", \"check\": run_check})\n    def example_plugin(event):\n        return {\"type\": \"success\", \"text\": \"example\", \"data\":{}}\n    \n\nThat's it.\n\n**Contact me**\nIf you have any requests for new plugins, or further comments about W.I.L.L, feel free to email me at will@willbeddow.com or leave an issue on the [Github page](https:\/\/github.com\/ironman5366\/W.I.L.L)\n\nW.I.L.L is very much still in development and I could use suggestions and advice\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edit**: I forgot about the API! W.I.L.L also provides a free JSON API to use it's features, easily allowing new clients to be written for any platform. It's currently lightly documented in the README, with an example in the quickstart. More extensive documentation is coming as soon as I figure out how I want to write it!\n",

   "description":"I work full time and take about 2 to 3 classes a semester. This semester I'm taking 3 classes. For the sake of anonymity I will just say they are STEM and specific to my major.\n\nI'm not going to lie. I am so stressed out and crunched for time that I honestly feel like I'm starting to lose it. I commute an hour each way, work 8 hours a day (Mon - Fri), and have classes mornings and nights. I'm averaging about 5 hours of sleep a nigtht, but some nights I'm so stressed out that I can't fall asleep. \n\nI have very little time to study. If I learn something Monday and have a quiz on it Wednesday that gives me no time to study for it because when I'm not in class I'm at work. The only time I really have to study is on the weekends. I spend maybe 8 hrs a day during the weekends in the library, but even after that I still know I'm going to fail at least one of my classes, because I'm just not getting it. That specific class has SI and tutoring, but I can't go because my schedule doesn't allow it. I've just accepted that at this point either something finally clicks or just treat this as prescribed for the next semester when I retake it.\n\nI would really like to talk to someone about certain thoughts I'm having, but I can't because all the available appointments to see a mental health counselor are during work hours. I don't really have the type of job where I can be flexible or regularly take time off. I know there is some type of group on campus for \"non-traditional\" students like myself but they are during working hours. I feel like every resource at this school is unavailable to me even if it's specifically targeted towards me. \n\nI don't have family to help me. To make a long story short, I'm was an orphan so I don't have any type of family that could help me out in anyway. I'm entirely on my own in life.\n\nMaybe I'm just not smart enough to major in a STEM field. Maybe I am but I just don't have the time. I don't want to graduate in 10 years. I mean I suppose that might be the only way because with this type of work load I'm worried I'll do something crazy and kill myself from the stress.\n\nHonestly if life is this hard what is the fucking point? If I have to be in this much pain to get a degree then how is it worth it?\n\nI know I'm just complaining but life is so difficult I just don't even feel like it's worth it anymore. I'm tired of platitudes that do nothing to alleviate the suffering and hopelessness that I feel everyday. I don't know what to do. I don't expect anyone to have any advice for me, I just need to let it out or I feel like I'm going to snap. \n\nThanks for listening.",

   "description":"**Background:** I'm in the final year of my CS program.  I don't need to take any classes between now and through the end of January 2020.  Before today, I thought I would've received an offer for an internship because it looked like it was a slam dunk: was told personality was perfect fit for position and firm, assessment was near perfect, but ultimately I can devote only 3.5 months full-time, and the project they had in mind would take longer to complete (initial phone interview started in late August).  HR said I'd be a shoe-in for a junior dev position there after graduating if one is available.  \n\n**Current State:** So now I'm wondering what to do next.  Fortunately, I was accepted into a mentor\/mentee program that starts tomorrow, so that'll be a great way to get advice, bounce off ideas and network; the mentors are recent graduates who work in the industry and the mentees are STEM students.  My main interest is software development and security.  I have previous work experience in a different field and can easily build rapport with people.  My resume is in a good condition (reviewed by several people and will have mentor review it as well).  Recently I earned the Security+ certification.\n\n**Next steps(?):**\n\n1) Start thesis\n\n2) Keep applying to internships\/part-time jobs\n\n3) Side projects - how to choose though?\n\n4) Attend additional classes\n\n\\#3 is especially vague.  I don't even know where to start.  I've worked on some toy apps before I started the program in order to learn the basics of programming and front=end, but that's it.  What does Reddit think?",

   "description":"Hi.  I'm a normal CS student at some university.  I first entered to programming world through iOS development in 11th grade.  I didn't do much after developing one super simple app that didn't even get to App Store.  Then I found out that there's a major dedicated to programming and related subjects so I applied and got into CS.  \n\nFrom school, I learned data structures, system programming, and data science, AI, and all those things that you would learn from usual CS courses.  For my side projects, I tried booting up an Ubuntu server on a machine and wrote simple scripts that would use APIs of various services on it.\n\nAll of these were fun.  However, they were not fun enough to stop me from watching TV shows, reading comics, or reading Facebook posts (these are my time-killing hobbies).  I'm not sure whether this is a matter of me not fully accepting the fact that programming could be a really enjoyable hobby or the nature of programming itself, or something else.\n\nOne thing that's working out well is that I'm following many software companies and programming community pages on Facebook, and I get a lot of exposure to some great blog posts and news articles about software and related topics, and I really like reading them.\n\nFinally, my point is that I want to really feel that geeky vibe.  I want to fall in love with programming.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with playing games, watching TV shows, cooking, and etc, but regardless of what I learn from school, I want to make my relationship with programming as something that resembles my relationship with my hobbies.  Since I will be learning technical sides of programming from school and online, I really want to learn how to love programming, how to make that mindset.\n\nJust to make sure, this is not about what kind of projects I should do in order to utilize what I learned.  It's more about for those of you who actually say my hobby is programming, why is it and how did that happen, what were some triggering moments that you feel that programming is so much fun?\n\nAny suggestion would be much appreciated.",

   "description":"Today I am releasing my first book, **Python 101**, for free for 48 hours. Python 101 was written as an introduction to the Python programming language. While it is intended for beginners, some have claimed that they needed more hand-holding than this book provided for them. So I currently recommend it as an introductory and intermediate book for developers that are looking to learn Python.\n\nWhen I originally wrote the book, I noticed that there were few or no books available that described how to create executables of your code or distribute your code via Python\u2019s Package Index (PyPI). Python 101 covers these topics as well as introducing the reader to Python\u2019s standard library, how to install 3rd party packages and an introduction to some of the most popular 3rd party packages for Python, such as SQLAlchemy, requests and virtualenv.\n\nPython 101 has **5 sections, 44 chapters and 295 pages**.\n\nYou can get Python 101 for free on Leanpub using the following link: http:\/\/leanpub.com\/python_101\/c\/48hours\n\nIf you happen to have a [Gumroad](https:\/\/gum.co\/bppWr) account, then you\u2019ll be able to get the book free there as well by using the following offer code: **48hours**\n\nYou will get the **PDF**, **epub** and **mobi** versions of the book. You can see a full table of contents on the Leanpub site\n\nIf you like my first book, you can get its sequel, **Python 201: Intermediate Python** for **50%** off here: http:\/\/leanpub.com\/python201\/c\/50percent\n\nI also write a fun [Python blog](http:\/\/www.blog.pythonlibrary.org\/) that has many other tutorials on it.",

Thy only other programming language channel I subscribe to is \/r\/cpp so I cannot help but compare the two.\n\nI am also aware that there is another channel that is probably more what I want: \/r\/pythoncoding .However it has only 8k subscribes while this channel has over 300k.\n\nObviously you could claim that this proves that the content of this channel is much better then \/r\/pythoncoding .However I think it is mainly because the latter is more obscure. I think it is a common sense to suppose that a programming subreddit of the format \/r\/<languagename> will always attract more people. I am a good example. It took me quite a while to realise that I am not getting the quality of the content I've expected from \/r\/Python .\n\nTherefore, am I the only one that thinks that all post that show off someone's cool Python stuff should have their own subreddit and \/r\/Python should focus more on the news, etc.?\n\nEDIT: Turns out that \/r\/pythoncoding is dead.",

The club will meet once every two weeks on the weekend to hang out, play card games, dinner, and etc. You guys are getting the gist. I was on board for several different clubs on campus and just realized it wasn't doing it for me. I'm not really looking to develop professionally and I don't really have any hobbies. It's cool to meet people of the same major but it gets boring. I want to meet different people. I'm looking to kick back, have fun, and meet people. Would you guys be interested? Lmao the name of the club is uh.... still a work in progress...\n\n\\*Update: Hey guys! Obviously quick update. I submitted the interest form to Student Life & Leadership. If everything goes according to my plan, i'll see ya'll next semester lmao.",

Checked my notebooks, texted people for some of my classes, but didn't figure it out. \n\nFast forward to this morning while talking to my boyfriend on the phone, \"I don't know what's due today, but I'll guess I'll find out when everyone turns it in.\" Well you wanna know what if fucking was??\n\nMy damn final paper for one of my classes! I have never in my life wanted to stab my eyeball with a pencil, smash my head into a wall, and cry all at once so bad.  Y'all, I fucked up really good today.

I was researching summer\/winter classes (and how to pay for them) earlier today, trying to put together a plan that'll have me graduate on time and all. Anyway, in my research I came across the link. Is this free online class in addition to the potential 18 credits we are allowed to take per semester? So, 21 in total (assuming the online class is 3 credits)? Also, it says 1 free class per semester or quarter. I know CSUF has semesters, not quarters, but they technically do offer summer and winter sessions. So would this be 1 free class per session, basically 4 free classes a year? What's your experience with it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso... I am actually a little annoyed my advisor never even mentioned this.",

   "description":"Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com\/sentdex](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/sentdex).  All tutorials are free in both text and video forms.\n\nThe latest series that I have put out is [Python for Finance](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance\/). The aim of this series is to show what can be done with Python in the field of finance and algorithmic trading using data science (spoiler alert: a lot!). \n\nEven though you probably aren\u2019t going to get rich, you might save yourself a lot of money (when you back test your silly trading idea and realize it\u2019s bad), and you\u2019ll learn about statistics and data science with Python along the way. \n\nI start the series off with a simplistic introduction to using Python+[Pandas](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial-introduction\/)+[Matplotlib](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/matplotlib-intro-tutorial\/)  to get stock data, visualize stock data, and to manipulate this data. \n\nFrom here, we get into Quantopian, which is a Python-based platform built on top of the Zipline library for back-testing, but has since expanded out to enable quite a bit more than that.\n\nWe use Quantopian both for simplistic back testing, but also for doing research into future trading strategies, since Quantopian also provides a bunch of free data like minute pricing data, fundamentals along with tools like [Alphalens](https:\/\/github.com\/quantopian\/alphalens) for analyzing various factors that you believe to be beneficial to a trading strategy.\n\nIf you would like to check it out, the series starts here: \n[Python for Finance introduction](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance\/)\n\nIf you are already familiar with Pandas and want to jump straight into the strategies and using Quantopian for back-testing and research:\n[Algorithmic trading and research with Quantopian](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/quantopian-trading-strategies-introduction-python-programming-for-finance\/)\n\nIf you have any questions, requests, or suggestions, feel free to ask here or on the respective tutorials.",

   "description":"Hello, long time lurker of this sub. I've been wanting to learn python for a long time because I've been making computer graphics with blender 3D for over 10 years. \n\n\nSo a little over a year ago I decided to start teaching myself. I started with codeacadamy's python course and then worked on several small personal projects. Such as automating some stuff at work. I then did [Udacitys Intro To Programming Nanodegree.](https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000) I overall feel pretty confident with python now, but it's hard to gauge how good you are at something if you don't reference it with other people. So here I am to share!\n\n\n\nSo I currently work as what is probably best described as a \"security guard supervisor\" all though it is a lot more than that. I work at a charity with a low income housing complex in which all guests or staff are required to sign in and out of the building. This is necessary because of certain laws requiring it with charities(it's complicated).  And also so roll calls can be done with the staff if there is a fire alarm.\n\n\nBefore they simply had a binder with a pen and paper to sign in and out. I asked around and found out that we could print barcodes easily on to our ID cards. So I figured the entire process is pretty low hanging fruit for automation. So I presented my idea to my manager and then later some directors and they approved, since it was practically a free solution, aside from my time on the clock. \n\n\nI did a back of the envelope calculation and determined this program would save about 400+ man hours a year. \n\n\n**TL;DR:** So long story short even though I'm a technically a security guard they let me write python and implement this new system. Which I've had a bunch of staff thank me for because the old way was a a lot more of a pain in the ass.\n\n[Here is the program I wrote.](https:\/\/github.com\/JosiahSwaim\/Punch-IN-OUT) \n\nI want to pursue programming as a career now so any advice is appreciated too.",

This would be an ideal **OPTION** because individuals who want to keep their GPA grade may, while others can receive the Pass Credit\n\n*Thank you so much for contacting our office with your concerns. Although many factors are beyond our control, we are sincerely sorry for how this semester has unfolded. At this time, there are no plans to convert classes to credit\/no credit. That said, we recognize that this unprecedented situation that we are facing can make it difficult to concentrate on academics. We also understand that the impact of virtual instruction varies from student to student and that it can be particularly difficult for some classes.*\n\n*I encourage you to work closely with your faculty to express your concerns and obtain guidance on how to finish the semester successfully. If you are not receiving the support that you need from your faculty, please contact the department chair. The department chair contact information can be found on the CSUF website,* [*www.fullerton.edu*](http:\/\/www.fullerton.edu\/)*, but you need any assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.*\n\n*I am also cc\u2019ing Erinn Banks, Chief of Operations for the Provost\u2019s Office. The Provost\u2019s Office is carefully monitoring these requests. If there are any updates, the campus community will be notified immediately.*\n\n*Thank you, Office of the Dean of Students Staff California State University, Fullerton* [*deanofstudents@fullerton.edu*](mailto:deanofstudents@fullerton.edu)",

   "description":"So forgive me if I am ignorant in thinking this, but I've only completed 2-3 college courses in programming \/ computer science.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I took  a class using C, I learned that an array is essentially one long chain of memory allocated for however long the array is.   Lets say you defined a variable n as an array of 100 ints, and you wanted to get the value of whatever int is located at index 10.\n\nint a = n\\[10\\];\n\nSo, in order for the computer to find index 10, does it not crawl up the chain until it finds 10?  Or does the computer make a math operation to figure out where in  the allocated memory 10 elements up is?  (Say, multiply 10 x the amount of bytes needed for one element).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it has to 'crawl', that means it's time complexity is 'linear' no?  Like O(n).  Otherwise it would be O(1)?",

   "description":"Hello everyone I am fairly new to using Reddit. I showed interest in going to an online school for a degree in computer science. This morning at 10:00 DeVry University called me and talk to me for about 45 minutes before they offered me a chance to join their upcoming computer science program for a associates degree. I am 44 years old, I basically was the biggest a****** in high school and did not do any school work didn't do anything though somehow ended up graduating only by myself not with my class (Long story lol). Anyway I love building computers I love learning about computers I love everything about computers I've been doing masonry and construction work since I was out of high school. I cannot take it anymore. I have an 8-year-old daughter and I want to be able to do better for her so I figured this is my next step. I'm already at the end of the process for the FIFCA(something like that) student loan process. Right now I am unemployed and I figured it is the perfect time to start something like this. And then possibly move on and get my bachelor's. I live in a pretty big area in between New York and Philadelphia and thought about making my own computer repair business where I would travel to people's houses and fix any issues they have with them. And also I would build computers if people wanted a certain kind of computer I would build it for them. I've had many people ask me to already. I just really want to get into knowing the technical details and really learning about computers. I'm leaving my options open I'm just going for an associates In computer science with an open end I suppose from what I was told there are three different routes I could take after that to get a bachelor's degree. Just wondering if anyone had opinions? thoughts? I start and just over two weeks and I have never been excited for school in my life and now I cannot wait. And I'm at the age of that and there's no such thing as too much information. Thank you for your time reading this, hoping it was coherent enough for you to get an understanding where I want to go with my life and maybe some perspective from some people who are there or have been there.",

   "description":"Hey everyone!\n\nI'm working full time and would like to obtain a master's degree in computer science. I currently hold a bachelor's degree from a well known state university.\n\nMy employer will pay for a large portion of my masters on the condition that I complete it entirely online (I must work full time). Here are some online computer science programs I've found:\n\n1) UIUC - Professional MCS. My second choice, not only because it is one of the highest ranked CS schools in the country, but because it only takes 2.5-4 yrs to complete.\n\n\n2) GA Tech - OMSCS. From what I've read online, this absurdly cheap ($7000!) CS program is top notch, with high quality videos and resources included as part of the program. Plus the acceptance rate is fairly high.\n\n\n3) Columbia CVN - MS Comp Sci... The Columbia video network provides the same exact degree as the on-site program. The Ivy League name brand is definitely a nice touch. It is quite pricey though.\n\n\n4) Johns Hopkins - MS Comp Sci. Not in the top 25, but still an extremely good program. They have a really cool robotics lab too, so that's a plus.\n\n\n5) Stanford - MS Comp Sci. My top choice for sure. Tied for #1 Comp Sci school in the country, but it's the only one with an online master's degree. According to their website, you had to be an employee at one of their \"member\" companies if you wanted to do an online masters through their HCP program. However, I just emailed someone from the department, and she said that this is **not** the case anymore.\n\n\n**Are there any other top CS schools, other than these five, that offer online computer science (or robotics\/AI) degrees?**\n\nEDIT: Schools listed in comments:\n\n6) Carnegie Mellon - Another #1 school. Only offers online degrees in Software Engineering, not computer science. Still a great choice for those who want to manage a team of software engineers one day.\n\n\nThank you!",

I work at a large company and honestly I shouldn't be as upset with it as I am however I feel unsatisfied.  She said that maybe I should start looking into careers I really want to do so I have a job title to seek out. \n\nI have worked a few internships and part time jobs in CS \/ IT. Here they are: \n-Software Development Intern\n-Network Technician\n-Remote IT Helpdesk Intern\n-Software QA Analyst Intern\n\nI really enjoyed the software development internship but it was soured by my attitude at the time as I wanted to work in hardware.  Now I really want to go back to software development but I also want to explore different careers.  Does anyone have any advice\/resources to help with this?\n",

   "description":"First and foremost, I would like to apologize for any grammatical or spelling errors. I'm in the middle of a study session and just need to vent a wee bit. \n\n\nTo give some background: I know nothing about computer science. I come from parents who barely know how to turn on a computer, and no one else in my family that has encouraged me to explore technology. If you were to ask me a year ago, I would he one of those people who would assume Java was short for javascript (heh). Not really knowing what to do for college I decided to give CS a try, and I honestly love it. \n\nFast forward to today, I am now completing my second CS class. In my first class, I spent countless hours with tutors and spent countless hours outside of class practicing on Codeacademy or any other outside sources to brush up. My first CS professor was terrible but I made every effort to keep up with the rest of the people in class. And yet, I passed with a 72 percent. Here I am, in my second class doing the same things I was doing last semester: extreme amounts of work for seemingly little result. My discouragement comes from seeing everyone else in the class already knowing the material before its taught, and realizing that I take twice as long for me to understand the concepts. I have a serious case of imposter syndrome despite my honest efforts and it almost feels like I dont belong. \n\nHas anyone else that has been in this position give any tips?\n\nEDIT:  I just want to give a HUGE thanks for everyone that has commented. I cannot reply to everyone at this time because I must keep my head down in my books (or laptop), but I truly do appreciate what everyone had to say. Overall, I would like to thank you for your comments that gave me a different perspective on the situation for a positive outlook, sharing a personal experience,  and also reminding me of important aspects and advice as I go through my journey. My spirits have been lifted and I'm ready to embrace the struggle. Thank you to all. ",

   "description":"Alright, this is kind of a long shot but I'm really curious. This is a throwaway account, by the way.\n\nLast semester during finals week I had a bit of a breakdown in my car. I was parked in the Nutwood Structure on the first floor and was full blown sobbing. This was probably around eleven or twelve at night, maybe even one AM. Two or three guys, I can't remember now, came up to me. I opened my door and one of them asked if I was okay, I said no, and he asked me to get out of the car. I was on the phone so I asked the person on the other line if I could call them back before I got out of the car.\n\nThe guy asked if he could hug me so I said he could. We hugged, then he asked me if I was upset over a boy. I said \"sort of\", explained it was my ex boyfriend and that we were best friends but had a fight and I didn't know if he'd ever speak to me again. The guy said something like, \"If you aren't sure that he's the one, then he isn't worth getting upset over.\" I don't remember exactly what was said, but I do know the words \"the one\" were spoken. I mentioned that I was mentally ill and that it wasn't helping the situation. Around then some girls pulled up in a car and the guy explained that was his ride, then he left.\n\nBasically, I put all of this information in this post in the hopes that this guy is reading it or that maybe someone will read it who knows him. That incident has stuck in my brain ever since it happened and I would love to have the chance to talk to you in person about how much that's meant to me but mostly to thank you properly. I felt like no one was there for me when this happened and the fact that somebody who didn't even know me would stop to make sure I was okay means the world to me. I honestly tear up every time I think of this, and I've thought about it a lot. I was an idiot when this happened (okay, I was just super emotional) and didn't ask for the guy's name, number, or even what year in school he was.\n\nIf it helps, I'm a girl, drive a blue Volkswagen Beetle, have short red hair and green eyes, am really short (about 5'1\"), and I think I may have been wearing prescription glasses at the time.\n\nETA: my car is powder blue, not blue. To some people it even looks gray. \n\n[Picture of my car](https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-9\/12592356_10206292583132965_3442141440966897234_n.jpg?oh=bbfdda31e31de0d2a8009ccf9f7b7580&oe=58F9E3CB)\n\n[Picture of my car 2](https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-9\/15492419_10207936392987184_7893840143350568676_n.jpg?oh=a16459691dea1f58cc79bffdd56474f9&oe=58FC4778)\n\n[Picture of me](https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-9\/1511594_10204077726922944_2762176791460066186_n.jpg?oh=6473d00f68b59c96a363f68dc963d456&oe=58B70A6D)",

   "description":"Does anyone else get slighlty annoyed when the field of CS is misinterpreted? For instance, many people outside of the field think that people within it are all about gaming PC\u2019s, RGB\u2019s everywhere and staying up-to-date on high-end components? In reality, I\u2019m really not interested in those at all, but I love CS. Except maybe if I hear about a super fast processor with very many cores, I\u2019ll read about it. Other than that, I couldn\u2019t tell you what the premier Nvidia GPU\u2019s specs are, and I\u2019m not really that interested. I think that it gives the wrong impression of the field, attracting those who really aren\u2019t into it, and leaving out those who would really enjoy it. Anyone else have similar thoughts or something to add onto this?",

This post is to elaborate on why our Computer Science Department is poorly constructed and why professors such as William McCarthy DESERVES to be fired. Aside from the numerous of negative post you will see just by simply typing his name with CSUF, I will be putting in my perspective about my experience with this \"person\". I will not be referring to him as a professor because simply put, he's not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy first encounter with William McCarthy began when I was enrolled in CPSC 301, a requirement class that every computer science student has to take in order to be approved for several upper division classes. For those who have never taken CPSC 301 yet, the first two weeks we are required to take an exam where it tests our programming skills to present date(Stuff from 120,121,131).  Our primary compiler used is called Visual Studio and that was what was on the computers that we needed to take the exam on. I took the exam just like everyone else and at the beginning of the 2nd week, McCarthy told us who failed and who passed. I unfortunately was on the list that did not pass. After class, I went up to him to discuss what was the mistake that I made, since I was heavily surprised that I had failed. I had taken the mid-EPP prep exam and scored reasonably high and even went to the workshop. He sat me down and showed me the mistake. **He used his own personal compiler to compile.** His own personally compiler detected a coding error that I had made, where if the code miraculously managed to escape without first going through my else(final case) statement, then the code returns nothing. This being a final case statement, means if everything fails, then the final case statement will be activated and run the code inside of there. This code statement is proper and did work on Visual Studio. No errors, ran multiple instances, all returning a valid input. But because **HE USED HIS OWN COMPILER** he decided to mark me as doing it improper. I felt that the situation was extremely improper because we were given the compiler to take our exam on, so why is he grading our project on his own compiler? I went to a professor that I was currently enrolled in and explained to him my situation and he ran my code via Visual Studio and saw that every case passes and that I should have received a 100%. Puzzled as well, he went to the department chair and informed them about the matter and managed to convince McCarthy to regrade all our exams using the School Provided Compiler. I was lucky enough to get out of the class because from my fellow classmates who were stuck and enrolled told me only the horrible things he said. He criticized the students for not reading x y z books and how that why they're horrible programmers. He critiqued about why students only know C++ and not know other languages despite C++ is what is taught as our primary language. Just... a horrible first experienced\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, I have him for 2 classes. My AI(artificial intelligence class) and my Game Development Class(Game Dev). For our AI class, he doesn't try to teach by the book and does it his way, which is extremely difficult for an introduction class. Like, we've been spending 13 weeks creating a bot that can train itself to play a specific game and at the end, only 1 group legitimately has it working and they had to help everyone. We sent him numerous of emails and went to his office hours and he would either curve the subject or give us such a shitty answer, that it doesn't even help. I've contacted the department chair about it and told him our entire situation and guess what he does. After that meeting, he was apparently suppose to go to our class and talk with us and the professor. Never showed up. For thanksgiving, we were suppose to play against each other's bot to see which is the strongest. Waste of fucken time. We all did that, and in lecture today, he wanted to do a fucken round robin. (so top 8 plays against each other so we get a top 4, then a top 2, and then we get our 'best bot'\". We have all played against each other during break, so we all knew who was at the top and whom were at the bottom, but he was so heavily insistent that we do the round robin that he wanted the top 8 teams to play against each other. Finding the class to be a waste of time, a majority of students had already left the class, some being part of the top 8. This annoyed McCarthy and what he did was he went to check on the remaining teams to see if they were still here. The few that was, he wanted them to play against each other. One of the teams, unfortunately did not bring his laptop to class because there was no mentioning of doing a round robin. McCarthy decided to lecture the student on why wouldn't he bring his laptop and on why didn't he have his bot running 24\/7.\n\n\\-deleted image as per request of the student-\n\nJust to mention, **the 24\/7 service that they wanted us to use is a PAID SERVICE, where we would PAY to keep our bot running.** The department mentioned how they'd reimburse us if we have to spend money, but never mentioned an amount. Sad to even say that the department wants us to pay for our grade? To add salt to our wounds, we also have to do a capstone project and still have our final exam in additional to said bot, because why not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-pending verification from the student of i may use their quote- A student mentioned out that mid-class, McCarthy talked about how CSUF students are lazy and how the school is horrible\n\nGiven our horrible situation, I decided to go and talk with our department chair and his response was\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/mGNNA20](https:\/\/imgur.com\/mGNNA20)  Department Chair Response\n\nHorrible response. \"Your professor isn't doing anything and you guys are suffering? Have you tried talking to him?\" Frustrated, I went even further into the school system and went and talked with the Dean of Students. I will not be posting their response since that seemed a little more private, but it went along the lines of \"We are sad to hear this but we can't do anything. Please try to discuss this with your Department Chair\". ... Great School. Also to mention, **the Computer Science Department Chair has even been avoiding reply to our Professor's Email for the last week**, since before thanksgiving. 3 Days into the week, he still hasn't returned to his office. \"Quoted from McCarthy himself\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll fill in details about my experience in his game development class but shorten down, haven't learned anything, gave us 2 weeks to make an 8 level super mario game, giving us 2 weeks to make a Crossy-Road game in UNREAL ENGINE without any tutorial or help because **\"There are too many Crossy-Road tutorials in Unity. Let's do Unreal\"!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I want to get out of this post is, as students, we shouldn't have to be dealing with this horrendous situation. Why am I paying money for an education where I spend more time googling up information than lecture. Why am I paying money for professors who doesn't want to teach? Why am I spending hours and hours driving to a class where I am not even learning?\n\nIf I can say one thing that I really learned from all my years at being in CSUF is that.\n\n\"The hardest part of CSUF is finding a good professor and not the course itself.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've honestly put in as much effort as I could in trying to deal with the situation. I have contacted the dean, the department chair, the professor and sadly been brushed away by all of them. I hope this could shine some light for those of you who want to come to CSUF, especially if you want to be a Computer Science Major.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12\/10\/19: I have received news that classes are now revealing the professors teaching the courses and it has come to my attention that McCarthy is still teaching several courses next semester. I find that very unacceptable given all the details and cases we have.\n\n [http:\/\/chng.it\/KkxZVK7jfv](http:\/\/chng.it\/KkxZVK7jfv) I highly recommend that if you want the situation to be looked at, then to sign the petition and bring attention to this matter and get the campus involved. \n\n\\*If you have anything you would like to add to the post anonymously, feel free to message me on discord as  **throw\\_away#1249**  or directly message me here on reddit and I will include it to the post. I will make sure your name is taken out. This post is meant to keep the school and department in check. If the department and professors are performing poorly and affecting the overall school atmosphere and credibility, wouldn't it be in our best interests to improve our situation? If bodies of students are having issues with a professor for a multiple of semesters, shouldn't that be something to be looked into and not brushed away? If everyone is just content with the situation at hand, then nothing will need to be done and this post can be ignored.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1 12\/4\/19: Added some photos of what happens in our class.\n\nEDIT 2 12\/5\/19: Added additional supporting links.\n\nEDIT 3 12\/9\/19: deleted image as requested by the student and updated links since the older links expired. Included \\* bullet about the post intention.\n\nEDIT 4 12\/10\/19: Added remark about how McCarthy is teaching next semester. + included petition link .",

   "description":"So long story short, I have been in the military for 12 years and 6 years ago I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science (a bachelors degree is required to become a commissioned officer and that was my goal). I have since then been involved in military Space Operations and have not used my degree at all. I also never used it as a civilian either since I haven't been a civilian since 2007. Now that I'm approaching my Major's board, the military would like me to have a Master's degree (not a hard requirement however I've learned soft requirements in the military can influence your career). So I'm looking to get a master's degree in Computer science, but I have no civilian working experience and have not coded in 6 years (even then I only did it for my undergraduate). Currently at work I use Matlab on and off for mission planning but that's about it, for my undergrad I used C++ and Java. \n My question is, how much is it going to suck? I still remember the basics but nowhere near where I should be. Are there any Computer Science refresher programs that I should look into before jumping into a master's program? Any books you all recommend? Other options are a master's in cybersecurity or a master's in Information Technology. \n\nThanks for your help!",

   "description":"My opinion is not very good.\n\nI'd give the overall experience a 5\/10.\n\nLittle background about me. I started a double major Business and Law, but never really liked it all that much. So I finished that but never actually got around to working in that specific field. I got really depressed about my lack of perspectives for quite a while (year and a half). After my mental health got a little better, I started to look for jobs that may interest me.\n\nI always had the entrepreneurial \"what if\" in my brain, and always looked up to coders. It seemed so cool and challenging from the outside. I started getting my head into it a little bit, but felt very overwhelmed. I did not really know where to start or what steps to follow. That's when I read about the whole bootcamp thing happening in the US. I read both good and bad opinions about them, so I decided to try for myself.\n\nFirst of all, I'm from Spain, so my experience has happened here in Madrid, where IMO the saturation of these has not arrived yet.\n\nAnyway, the bootcamp itself provided a warranty of 100% employment, so I said \"well, that's good\" and enrolled. The duration was 3 months. I told myself \"so 100% employment after a 3-month course? That's great!\".\n\nThe whole thing started with a \"review\" of an online course they made us do on HTML and CSS, and that lasted around a week. After that we went straight into vanilla JS, and right after that, they taught us Angular. In terms of front-end we were also taught Bootstrap, SASS and Semantic. Then the back end part arrived, to my surprise only when we were 3 weeks from finishing. They just went really fast with MySQL, NodeJS, MongoDB. Finally they shoewed us a bit of the framework Ionic, for mobile development, so we could get a glimpse of what developing for a cellphone would look like.\n\nThe whole thing had to end with a full-stack project, which needless to say, did by myself with the help of internet resources.\n\n\nSo, my opinion. It's just too much stuff for a 3 month period. You end up just barely knowing the stuff, and becoming a master of none. I've been asked in telephone interviews what my experience was, and it just seemed stupid when I'd tell them everything I've just told you in this post. Had they asked me anything in particular about those technologies I'd have probably fainted.\n\nNow I'm just skeptic as to what my job prospects are, at least as my first position. They did sign a contract with the 100% employment thing.\n\nOverall, I've found Udemy and personal projects to be the best source of learning. In terms of books, I've only been able to read \"Javascript: from novice to ninja\" and it's been of great help.\n\nI belive that it is essential to master the basics of programming itself since those will always be the foundation of any programming language, and I've only found that out myself. The first JS class was like \"OK. So JS is programming language which uses variables to...\" and I was like \"mmm... ok. Give me a little background here?\".\n\nI don't know. I'm a little disappointed in myself for believeing that I'd know my shit after 3 months. Now I'm considering the idea of getting into CS degree at 25 years old. It's never late, and I really like the field, but I think it'd be better for me to learn everything from scratch.\n\nHope this helped to those who are considering the idea of joining a coding bootcamp. The Internet is your friend, and bootcamps nowadays don't give you much of a credential. Luckily, in this field it's all about experience,and not certificates. Despite all that, I'd really like to get into the degree. I feel like that's my true call.\n\nThanks for reading and best of luck.",

Tried looking for a pinned post for this but couldn't find anything. Recently have been doing some reading and listening to speakers at Davos and more and more it seems like AI and Machine Learning are going to be the world's next greatest technological advancement with unprecedented ramifications across any and all aspects of life.\n\nAt the moment, I'm a only Political Science student who has only spoke\/learned about AI from a policy standpoint. However, even then it seems that without a technical understanding of these concepts it's almost impossible to begin to think about how to legislate such technologies. In a similar vein, I've also become very interested in learning more about both of these concepts, but it seems like most CompSci and CIS grad programs require a STEM undergrad or some prior exposure to the field. Am i out of luck or are there \"bridge\" programs for CIS\/CompSci? Thanks for your help!",

   "description":" Had a noteworthy event at work today. I have an internship with Amazon for the summer, but it with the Data Center Operations divisions. So working with servers mostly. But I found a way to make an impression on my manager today using Python. I can't go into specific details of what we were working on (NDA and confidentiality and all) but I can talk about what I did. \n\nWe were working with a large number of assets (327 total) and part of that work involved compiling information about those assets. Well as an intern I get all the crap jobs. So I got handed that job. So for 2 days, I've been working on compiling the info in a spreadsheet. Thought I was finished but found I only had information for 319 assets. Well, we can't just 'lose' 8 assets. That kind of looks bad on a record. So my manager wanted me to go through the list of total assets and figure out what 8 we didn't have info for. I'm like 99% sure he was expecting me to go line by line in excel and do a CTRL+F to see which ones from the total list weren't on the info list. A nice little process that would likely have taken me the better part of the day to accomplish.   \n\nInstead, I pulled up python, threw together a script to build 2 lists (one for total assets, one for the information I had compiled) and then compare the lists. Anything it found in the totals list that it didn't find in the info list got dumped to a text file.  \n\nTotal time: 18 minutes (I had to look up some info on the xlswriter module).  \n\nMy manager literally said: \"How the hell did you do that?\" when I showed him the list 20 minutes after we spoke.",

Python is much slower than C++. How can it make sense to use Python in situations when large data is processed, performance-wise?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne company asked me the question \"How to bind a C-function to Python that computes a 1GB floating-point array, and then to compute a total of all numbers in Python?\" They ask this question from the position when they assume that the use of Python is totally normal, and one should do such things as computing a 1GB fp array in C, then copying it into a gigantic Python list, then computing a total of numbers in Python. But this question in itself assumes that things are done extremely inefficiently, isn't it? They are just indoctrinated and think that things that they do are normal when they are far from normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why is Python used so widely, as opposed to using C++, for example?

   "description":"I just had a wonderful realization and I thought I might share. To preface this, I always wanted to go to Hogwarts as a kid and learn magic. I became somewhat disenfranchised with the world as I grew older, but I have recently begun to rekindle a sense of wonder and excitement for the world.\n\nA big part of that has been learning to code. I was thinking about this the other day, and I realized that I have essentially been learning magic by any standard throughout history, and for some reason I take that for granted!\n\nThrough a high-level language, we manipulate electrons in order to create symbolic information patterns that can accomplish real tasks - to anyone from any other time in history, if they could see us they would think we were literally witches and wizards.\n\nAt Hogwarts the students learn to predict the rough future through magic. I can do the same with data analysis, game theory, and machine learning networks. They can see things from the other side of the world - I just finished coding a security cam for my dorm. They can imbue non-living matter with sentience - robotics. They can manipulate life - bioinformatics - if I had access to the right tools I could literally breed glowing animals. Artificial intelligence adds an even cooler aspect to this given we might soon be able to create sentience from non-sentient matter! Even the bad powers, killing people, controlling people etc are real - consumer programming, psychometric targeting through the internet, drone strikes, malicious hacking, etc.\n\nBy extension, everything we are exploring in modern science is really magic. We don't really know how this stuff works or why it works - if you look at the physical constants of the universe they seem somewhat arbitrary. While we do have a good sense of the relational properties between things in reality, we don't know why they are what they are - like electrons! We know the rules that dictate their interaction with other things in reality, but we don't know why they exist the way they do, where they came from, or for that matter where any of this really came from! Somehow through all these layers of abstraction, from basic properties of atoms and forces, to high-level symbolic computation, we manage to actually do stuff, and that stuff is no less absolutely amazing! I don't think it's hyperbole to say that we're all doing real magic.",

   "description":"Nowadays Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Specialists value its universality for all types of the tasks. Today, one of the most important qualities is convenience of command execution, but often developers have to write a relatively simple program, the quality criterion of which is an intuitive graphical interface. You have several ways to do this by means of Python. The following development tools are among the most popular:\n\n* [PyQt](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/PyQt5\/). The widespread Qt library, which implementations are available in various languages. It\u2019s written in C++ and is cross-platform. This library allows the development of applications that have familiar and ordinary appearance in the general sense of this word.\n* [Tkinter](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/tkinter.html)**.** This tool is often referred to as standard for developing GUI applications in Python, appeared back in the early 90s of the twentieth century. Due to the long history and ease of use, Tkinter has a rather extensive and active community. It\u2019s thanks to it you can find a large number of semi-finished products or publications in the network and get an answer to any question at specialized forums.\n* [WxPython](https:\/\/wxpython.org)**.** Another descendant of C++, namely WxPython, links the wxWidgets cross-platform library with Python. In some ways, Tkinter and WxPython are quite similar, but WxPython is slightly younger and is more advanced approach to creating GUI applications in Python. Also, the entry barriers for the start are quite low due to the rapidly developing and friendly community. Perhaps the installation and the first steps will require a little more effort than the tools described above, but believe me, the result is worth it!\n\nAt a certain stage I chose PyQt for my work and in this article would like to show you an example of creating the simplest application for a content manager; so you\u2019ll get to know the GUI for Python, libraries for natural language processing, and several ways of creating \\*.exe file from \\*.py for Python 3.6 script.\n\n# Step 1. Python GUI: Creating simple application with PyQt and Qt Designer\n\nFirst you need to understand what software is wanted. The content manager of [Casino Now](https:\/\/casino-now.co.uk) project gives priority to such parameters of content as\n\n* Word count\n* Number of characters\n* Percentage of stop words\n* Keyword density\n* Presence of keywords in headers\n* List of popular n-grams\n* Text\u2019s uniqueness\n\nIf for some reason you haven\u2019t yet installed the PyQt library, the simplest method is to enter this code in the command line\n\n    pip3 install PyQt5\n\nAll support tools will be installed automatically. When the installation is completed, open Qt Designer and create the necessary form using standard elements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 1 \u2013 General view of the dialog box](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ch0j426wgxe21.jpg?width=1138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd0047e99d031a95d1632d9e7476c7836dd69e04)\n\nThe following is the layout of future application. Don\u2019t judge too harshly, this is just an introductory demo to show several possibilities ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 2 \u2013 Dialog box](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i1e9saywgxe21.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9236d074fa9b40151e6343d5dce1174468984e86)\n\nBear in mind the specialized tools to keep the graphical interface user-friendly regardless of workspace\u2019 scaling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 3 \u2013 Example of saving workspace proportions when scaling](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jeez8qxxgxe21.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1d0b6f128132a2185c83ad78e89d988b448f3f6)\n\nIn order to turn the interface into a program code for use, you have to save the resulting layout. Thus, the file with MainForm.ui extension is received. To get access in the framework from the project, you need to convert the MainForm.ui file to the \\*.py extension. To do this, go through the command line to the folder containing the file with \\*.ui and run the following command\n\n    pyuic5 -x MainForm.ui -o MainForm.py\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 4 \u2013 File conversion](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/az5emddzgxe21.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=256f04d8bd8b32b7f697e9f9cf61260eeec995bf)\n\nThus, you get the file of required extension and can run a prototype of the application.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 5 \u2013 Plug-ins of the developed application](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/35qvip40hxe21.jpg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdcd1fa72dc01dd2bc79dc2af6d298a9859c341a)\n\nThe full source code has the structure presented at Figure 6. You can find the expanded version on my Github [https:\/\/github.com\/TinaWard](https:\/\/github.com\/TinaWard). In this article, I\u2019d like to explain the application\u2019s build in more detail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 6 \u2013 Application code](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qqkq0331hxe21.jpg?width=889&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee7b345c93410ffe5fb7fec4a6145874427e788b)\n\n# Step 2. How to convert python script in exe\n\nThe most popular tools for building an application today are [PyInstaller](https:\/\/www.pyinstaller.org) or [cx\\_Freeze](https:\/\/anthony-tuininga.github.io\/cx_Freeze\/). For this article let\u2019s focus on such building method as cx\\_Freeze. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s analogous to PyInstaller with the only difference that in case of PyInstaller you don\u2019t need to write your own installer script (setup.py), but at the same time, the similar manipulations must be performed via the command line or in the \\* .spec file. The tool cx\\_Freeze is set in the standard way:\n\n    pip install cx_freeze\n    pip install \u2013user cx_freeze\n\nThe first step in creating a full-fledged application is the proper formation of the setup.by file.\n\nThe following is the frame of this file. The steps of the **setup.by** file are intuitive, but let\u2019s look in more detail. First of all, import two entities: the setup function and Executable class. The most informative is the **options** dictionary (dictionary of dictionaries as it's usually called), which is used to improve the build. It may have such parameters:\n\n* **excludes** \u2013 list with description of modules not to be included in the assembly. You shouldn\u2019t overuse this parameter, since you can overdo and delete what you really need: nested dependencies.\n* **includes** \u2013 parameter opposite to excludes, that\u2019s the list of signal modules that must be included in the assembly. Also cx\\_freeze may not find some packages or modules, in particular if they were imported into similar package using the import function. If you have a GUI application, you have to specify the name of the script with the \\*.py extension, in our case it\u2019s **MainForm**.py.\n* **packages** \u2013 compulsory packages to be included.\n* **zip\\_include\\_packages** \u2013 list of packages to be archived\n* **include\\_files** \u2013 list of lines or files tuples that need to be added to the assembly, but these are not Python files.\n\nNow let's take a closer look at the Executable class:\n\n* **targetName** allows you to specify the name of the \\*.exe file, by default it matches the name of the launching script.\n* **base** = **\u2018Win32GUI\u2019** If you set a parameter as described in the example, it means that the graphical application is processing and the console window will not appear.\n* **icon** \u2013 parameter to set the icon of the application launcher, by default uses pictures with \\*.ico ext.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    \n    from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable\n    import os\n    options = {\n    'build.exe': { 'icludes': ['MainForm'], 'packages': ['pandas'], 'excludes ': excludes } }\n    os.environ['TCL_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\tcl\\tcl8.6'\n    os.environ['TK_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\tcl\\tk8.6'\n    setup(\n    name = \"TextTool\", version = \"0.0\", description = \"Here write smth\", options = options, executables = [Executable('TextToolS.py', targetName = \u2018ThisIsName.exe\u2019)])\n\nTo compile you need to run the setup.py file. To do this, enter the following code via the command line from the project directory:\n\n    python setup.py build\n\nAfter that you will see the launch of the project build.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 7 \u2013 Running project build](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jgtrlj6khxe21.jpg?width=655&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480540ce993a8208c81fce78d18c3413149f8f9b)\n\nBuilding a project can take from 10 seconds to several minutes, depending on the size and number of interconnected modules in your application.\n\nNot always the project build runs smoothly, let\u2019s look at some of the most common mistakes. Most of them can be solved by searching and writing in the correct parameters of the setup function in the setup.py file, but often due to laziness or lack of time, the temporary ways are implemented to solve this problem. For example, this one, when you haven\u2019t specified the module\u2019s addition:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 8 \u2013 Error example](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dx9fl0glhxe21.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3955eff4159f0fdff1a670fe7d664e05f11a5cce)\n\n    \"Missing required dependencies {0}\".format(missing_dependencies))\n    ImportError: Missing required dependencies ['numpy']\n\nTo make this just copy \\_methods.py file from Anaconda library\n\n\u2026\\\\Anaconda3\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\numpy\\\\core\n\nto numpy folder \u2018core\u2019, located\n\n\u2026\\\\build\\\\exe.win-amd64-3.6\\\\lib\\\\numpy\\\\core.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 9 \u2013 First type error fix](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jd0b7ufnhxe21.jpg?width=794&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f7e9f296b4f18d85b7466810e16af8af6527de6)\n\nThe second common mistake is undersampling hidden dependencies. It\u2019s possible that you didn\u2019t see the hidden dependencies of the packages and didn\u2019t add it. Often the problem occurs with packages like idnadata\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 10 \u2013 Second type error](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/46jgu19ohxe21.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e60341d7b67b77cad604b95cbcfb313ddc1edd69)\n\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tldextract\\__init__.py\", line 3, in <module>\n    from .cli import __version__\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tldextract\\cli.py\", line 14, in <module>\n    from .tldextract import TLDExtract\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\tldextract\\tldextract.py\", line 62, in <module>\n    import idna\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\idna\\__init__.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    from .core import *\n    File \"C:\\Users\\User3\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\idna\\core.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from . import idnadata\n    ImportError: cannot import name 'idnadata'\n\nThe algorithm is the same, you find the missing file in the folders of the installed libraries and copy it in the appropriate folder of your assembly. This\u2019s win-win option if you need a quick compilation for testing.\n\nFrom \u2026\\\\Anaconda3\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\idna to \u2026\\\\build\\\\exe.win-amd64-3.6\\\\lib\\\\idna\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 11 \u2013Second type error fix](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/exn2z8tphxe21.jpg?width=692&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2963ac8ae8552f8295d824068ad19c9d7578c062)\n\nIn general, the advantages of cx\\_Freeze are:\n\n* Startup files for Linux\n* MSI installers for Windows\n* RPM packages for Linux\n* Software packages for Mac OS X (.app, .dmg)\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n\n* No possibility to pack all python-modules and dll-files in one exe-file\n* No cross compilation\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this article we have looked at the principles of creating a GUI application in Python using PyQt and compiling the created app to \\*.exe by means of cx\\_Freeze.

   "description":"This may be a bit dated, but going through my adolescence in the mid to late 2000th, the revival of the [fast inverse sqrt method](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fast_inverse_square_root) and the air of mystery surrounding this strange number, 0x5f3759df, made it one of those things where anyone who would ever dare to call themselves a programmer would know the reference to. Trying to understand this method, and its magical constant, was sort of my white whale. It wasn't until 2014, right after I graduated from college, that I finally understood how the method came about. It's actually deceptively simple, and I think that anyone, with a bit of luck, could have come up with this constant.\n\nIn fact, you could even create up constants for the sqrt, inverse cube root, and any rational or irrational powers. You can also use a similar technique to create approximations of exp, log, and geometric means.\n\nThe fast inverse sqrt method is essentially this approximation:\n\n\n    float invsqrt(float y) {\n      int i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       \/\/ evil floating point bit level hacking\n      i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               \/\/ what the fuck? \n      return * ( float * ) &i;\n    }\n\n\nin essence, it seems like if you take the bitwise IEEE 754 representation of the float y, as a 32bit integer, divide it by 2 (the left shift by 1), then subtract it from 0x5f3759df, and finally treat it as a float again, then you somehow get a value that seems to approximate 1\/sqrt(y), with up to 10% relative error for the range of floating point numbers.\n\nWhy?\n\nTo answer this question, let's start with some simpler notations. We'll use the function float2int(y) to denote the conversion that takes in a IEEE 754 floating point number, and outputs its machine representation as a 32bit int; basically what the first line does. We'll also define the inverse function int2float(i) that performs the reverse conversion. Obviously, float2int and int2float will be inverses of each other.\n\nNow, the question is why int2float(0x5f3759df - float2int(y) \/ 2) approximates the inverse sqrt function.\n\nWell, this is where the luck comes in. Assuming that you got curious and started looking at the function\n\n    f(y, m) = int2float(m - float2int(y) \/ 2)\n\nand you have a plot where you can fix an arbitrary constant m, and plot out the curve for f(y, m) in terms of y, what would you see?\n\nWell, as luck would have it, you can [try this out](http:\/\/www.phailed.me\/2014\/10\/0x5f400000-understanding-fast-inverse-sqrt-the-easyish-way\/#Adding%20Alpha).\n\nIf you plot the curve for just invsqrt(y) on the same graph, you'll notice that, as you vary m, your function is just a multiplicative factor away from invsqrt(y). That is, f(y, m)\/invsqrt(y) is linear-ish, and your task is to find the value of m that makes this ratio go to 1 (or as close to 1 as you can manage for as many values of y as you can manage).\n\nSo how do we solve this problem? Well, the way that the original authors did was to treat this as a boundary value problem; e.g., use some value of y that simplifies the equations as much as possible. Their choice was to set y = 1 at one end of the boundary:\n\n    1 = f(1, m)\/invsqrt(1)\n\nthis simplifies to\n\n    1 = int2float(m - float2int(1)\/2)\/1\n\nand recalling that int2float and float2int are inverses, we have\n\n    float2int(1) = float2int(int2float(m - float2int(1)\/2)\/1)\n      = m - float2int(1)\/2\n\nwhich gives\n\n    m = 1.5 * float2int(1)\n\nI'll save you the troubles of computing `float2int(1)`, it is 0x3f800000, so, to satisfy the boundary condition, the magic constant would come to be `1.5 * 0x3f800000 = 0x5f400000`.\n\nThis is very close to the 0x5f3759df, so how do we close the gap? Well, it turns out that if you graph the errors of this plot, you'll notice that the error is always positive. As a result, if you just subtract a little bit off of 0x5f400000, you can actually halve the absolute value of the error by shifting half of the error down into the negative side. Finding the optimal constant is then a simple task of bisecting through viable constants while minimizing the maximum absolute value of the relative error.\n\nThis method also generalizes to arbitrary powers. It turns out that for any power, c, you can approximate y^c by\n\n    int2float(0x3f800000 * (1 - C) + C * float2int(y))\n\nAnd finally, with a bit of analysis, you can also derive analogue laws for exp and logarithms, e.g. in https:\/\/github.com\/leegao\/float-hacks#exp-redux.",

   "description":"Feel free to sound off below on anything you may be hearing! Please remember to stick to the facts and avoid speculation. I\u2019ll try to update consistently throughout it. \n\nUpdate: Refunds and reimbursements will NOT be happening for the Spring 2020 semester, as per President Virjee.\n\nUpdate: Fall 2020 being fully online was a false report and a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d, says Provost Oliver. She states that \u201cwhat we want to do is follow what the governor says, and what the Chancellor\u2019s office says\u201d, and that it\u2019s important to keep in mind that \u201cthings can change very quickly\u201d \n\nUpdate: Internships, visual arts, research, and lab classes will have \u201cpriority\u201d for being instituted face-to-face first when classes resume, if that is a possibility. Oliver still states that while the circumstances are not optimal, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to give a generic answer- it depends. I know that answer is unsatisfactory to all of you.\u201d\n\nUpdate: on the Titan Experience- VP for student affairs, Mr. Le Grand, states that \u201cfullerton.edu\/students\u201d has information on how clubs and organizations may continue to meet. In regard to the emergency funding for students states that even though the campus will get $41 million as a result of the CARES act, \u201cwe don\u2019t have a check yet\u201d and to \u201cbe patient\u201d as we \u201clook for ways to get the money to students once it actually happens.\u201d Also encourages students in need to reach out to Tuffy\u2019s Basic Needs service. \n\nUpdate: Commencement- due to social distancing requirements, they are \u201crunning scenarios\u201d and state that it is \u201ctough managing the unknown\u201d but that \u201cit is our goal to have every student walk across the stage when that becomes available\u201d. No date is given, but \u201cat some point\u201d it will happen. Right now, a virtual celebration is being discussed. It\u2019s \u201cexciting,\u201d that \u201cwe will be able to have something this spring\u201d, states Greg Saks about this virtual option.\n\nUpdate: 37 minutes in, moderator Ellen Treanor states \u201cwe have addressed most questions\u201d and has the panel share their final thoughts.\n\nUpdate: Dr. Amir Dabirian, VP of Information Technology states that \u201ctechnology\u201d should not be an issue for students and that should you need any tech, they will try their best to coordinate that and ship it to you.\n\nUpdate: Dean of Students Hallie Hunt says \u201cif you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us, we are here for you.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Provost Oliver thanks all students \u201cfor sticking with their education while facing stress of academics, life, and family. Congratulations for sticking with your education. We will be able to answer specific questions about Credit\/No Credit if you submit them to the website.\u201d She thanks the Academic Senate and states that she hopes this will help take some of the stress off. \u201cI appreciate the gratitude that you have for us. We are working as hard as we can because we believe in you. You\u2019ll probably hate me for this, but I hope you\u2019ll be able to write a few of your thoughts during this time. This is a very unusual time in history, but trust me, take some notes and it\u2019ll be a good time soon enough to share that with your grandchildren.\u201d\n\nUpdate: President Virjee- \u201cif students need a laptop, or mobile WiFi space, a cellphone, a charger, we will help you out on that.\u201d States that if you have IT problems, to please use the IT website to navigate those concerns.\n\u201cI think we have the most friendly grading option anywhere in the country\u201d- states that we have a ten day period after we see our grade, we can then make an \u201cinformed decision\u201d, states that those looking at grad school, student athletes, and those receiving financial aid should speak to academic advisors but that ultimately, \u201cit is your decision, that is in your hands.\u201d\n\nUpdate: President Virjee says \u201cwe have the best attendance in class now than ever\u201d and that he is proud of how \u201cinspiring\u201d we are to the \u201cnext generation of Titans that are coming in\u201d and that we have tenacity, kindness, and grit. \u201cIn other words, it takes a Titan!\u201d\n\u201cI want to shake your hand when you cross that stage.\u201d\nPresident Virjee just got slightly emotional and had to pause for a moment after his voice broke. He states that \u201cwe will get through this together.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Virtual Town Hall just ended, 53 minutes after it started. Sound off below y\u2019all, it may not be much but at the very least we\u2019ve got each other.",

   "description":"I'm currently trying to decide on what kind of career path I would like to lead in the future. I am aware that computer science draws heavily on coding and I would like to know more about possible job opportunities \/ research opportunities in this career field. I have a little background knowledge of machinery from my previous experiences, which I am hoping will come in handy as I slog my way through the study area. Any advice \/ help would be appreciated. \n\nAlso, I forgot to mention but I am interested in making games and creating software that helps with engineering analysis (eg. FEA Analysis), although I haven't been directly involved with any of these experiences before (but I would love to). Are there any age restrictions for programming or for someone to qualify as a programmer as such and if so what is your threshold? I am worried that due to my mature age, I might be prevented from working as a programmer after I graduate (I will be almost 30 by the time I graduate). \n\nAny programmers in Japan? Could you let me know what fields of programming Japanese are mostly interested in and if there are any opportunities for Gaijin? I met this programmer at a recent Japanese language test center (for which I have been studying as a hobby for the last five years) and he seemed interested in moving to the country with his girl friend (nihonjin) after his success with the game he and his studio team had been working on. It's apparently a game with a shark and emphasis on underwater experiences. It seemed much like Subnautica but with a darker twist on it. I haven't played the game personally, only watched Let's play videos on YouTube by a famous Youtuber but it was interesting. \n\nI have no idea regarding details of what computer science as a field entails. It has only recently come to my attention as I realised that many internships in college and jobs require knowledge of programming and this is actually an employable skillset to have, which is one of the reasons I am considering. (Another reason is that I personally feel interested in learning more about algorithms such as Artifical Intelligence). A potential drawback I see to studying this field is that I won't be able to pursue another opportunity while I study the degree and there will be countervailing costs to it in the end that offset amounts of time and money I spend on studying it. \n\nHence, I would be interested to know what kinds of job opportunities are out there for people who study in this area and their experiences in undergrad and workforce. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my question. I look forward to hearing your answers.",

It's a humble attempt to organise and expand some posts I published on my blog in the last years, and has already been downloaded by more then 3,000 readers.\n\nYou can find it here: https:\/\/leanpub.com\/clean-architectures-in-python\n\nThe main content is divided in two parts, this is a brief overview of the table of contents\n\n* Part 1 - Tools - Chapter 1 - Introduction to TDD - Chapter 2 - On unit testing - Chapter 3 - Mocks\n\n* Part 2 - The clean architecture - Chapter 1 - Components of a clean architecture - Chapter 2 - A basic example - Chapter 3 - Error management - Chapter 4 - Database repositories\n\nSome highlights:\n\n- The book is written with beginners in mind\n\n- It contains 3 full projects, two small ones to introduce TDD and mocks, a bigger one to describe the clean architecture approach\n\n- Each project is explained step-by-step, and each step is linked to a tag in a companion repository on GitHub\n\nThe book is free, but if you want to contribute I will definitely appreciate the help. My target is to encourage the discussion about software architectures, both in the Python community and outside it.\n\nI hope you will enjoy the book! Please spread the news on your favourite social network\n\nThe book will soon be translated into Russian by \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u041f\u044b\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044b\u043d (Alexey Pyltsyn), who already worked on the translation of technical books like \"The Majesty of Vue.js 2\" and \"The Road to learn React\".\n\nAlexey is a web developer and maintainer of the official PHP documentation in Russian.

The person on the phone call also stood by the technician's opinion when I tried to ask if a secondary review had been conducted.\n\nWhile I have no doubt that this is going to be resolved (my diploma is absolutely real, and I worked very hard through some very tough times to earn it\u2014given time, I can request all the info needed to prove that as soon as quarantine ends), I'm worried that this could impact my academic standing or status with the school while it gets cleared up. Should I be worried? Are there any steps I should be taking or people that I should be talking to about this?",

   "description":"As one of the many students that just finished watching that \"virtual town hall\", I was incredibly disappointed to see how they handled that. Hundreds of questions and over two hours scheduled, and all we got was a few people telling us \"it depends\", and \"I don't know\" before congratulating themselves over and over again, and treating us to a president who can't stay composed during a time that is extremely trying for all of us\u2014all while cutting the meeting almost 80 minutes short.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, our \"student governance\" has essentially disappeared, enrollment is down 20% (according to one of my mentors who is a reputable source within MSBE), **we** are suffering, people are dying and getting sick. Many of us have had to completely (and in some cases, traumatically) shift our lives because of this, and they can't even sit through a 2 hour meeting to answer our questions?  \n\n\nI understand that there is a lot going on behind the scenes, but it really stung to get my hopes for critical information up for a week only to be met with \"Thank you for that excellent answer\" and \"I'm so excited but we don't know\". I don't think that these are the people that should be leading us in this time of crisis, and if they haven't been able to step up right now, why should we expect them to step up after this passes?  \n\n\nApologies in advance for the rant. Let me know if anyone thinks of anything we can do to improve this situation or actually enact accountability towards the student body.",

   "description":"Recently I've been having increasing concerns about giving out my data to big companies like Google and Microsoft. What I mostly think sparked those is a video on youtube talking how a team might accidentally build an AI for a certain purpose that would get fed too much data and it would take over our world in an absurd way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Now don't get me wrong I'm not specifically afraid of AI* but I started switching from Google to DuckDuckGo and from Microsoft to Linux based OS' probably mostly because of all the hate for data abuse.While I still think collecting data has many many great improvement purposes I feel like I'm missing something important that everyone is panicking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**After listing a few pros and cons of giving out data I'd like to ask you a few questions:**\n\n**- Pros:**\n\n* Giving out data lets improve the services I'm using\n* It allows for a free web\n* Personalized ads are better than some random ones. (i.e. job ads)\n\n\\- **Cons:**\n\n* The competing services are subpar\n* Allows for abuse of my data\n* Companies are putting more and more backdoors into the software\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am aware that selling data and using it to improve own services are two different things. Also it's the governments' job to regulate and protect the data with laws, however things are as they are and the main question is should I battle the internet for privacy*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My questions are:**\n\n* **Why is putting backdoors into software considered immoral and what are the best argument against this** (for business and personal use)\n* Are my concerns about data being abused valid\n* Should I put in the effort to go off the grid and become anonymous or is the convenience I get worth th*e personal data\\** I give out to Google or Microsoft (is this a win-win situation perhaps)\n* Is it wrong feeding google or facebook so much \"Big Data\"\n* (bonus question) With increasing efforts from companies to merge all their products under one platform should we allow them the monopolies they are creating and what are upsides and downsides of those (convenience **vs** difficulty to switch to different products).\n\n\\**Note that personal data I'm refering to might range from my medical problems, personal pictures, real estate data, finances...* all of which can be used by an alogrithm to create my personal profile\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Sorry if the post is a one big mess (just like my thoughts right now). You're free to give me feedback on how to style it better.",

   "description":"There's about 50 open spots over there, right past you, yet you want me to park in the hot sun? Or in the super far spot when there's open parking a foot away? No. And yes, I know how to pull into a space. Is it because I'm a girl or college student or you're that bored? My data structures prof would ask us every day, \"is better sorting possible?\". Now I like to ask myself if better parking is possible. It's usually a yes. Why would I park under the sun when I can get a tree spot? It's like there's no order to how they fill the spaces. It's so funny and sad when they get all offended when you drive past, or leave the shit spot when they look away. That's a tiny amount of power you're letting get to your head. I'd also love to know why you stand there and stare at me resting in my car. No, I'm not giving you my keys. It should be obvious I don't want to talk. I'm barely functioning as it is right now. And yes, I parked a tiny bit off...like a millimeter. I CAN FIX IT. You do NOT need to dash up to my running car, dance around waving your arms like an idiot, and circling like a seagull. You're in my blind spot....of course I'm not going to move, I can't see if I'm gonna hit you...so stop yelling at me. Can't hear you anyway. Move your ass so I can fix the parking job. Maybe go around the lot and ticket those assholes who park diagonally in 2 spaces. Go back under the shade and chat with your friends. If I need help, I'll ask. Just chill out for a second. This is a parking lot, not a mine field or presidential event or hospital in the middle of a superbug outbreak.",

   "description":"The most asked question I see when it comes to learning programming is \"How do I get started?\".\n\nI feel like what you really mean to be asking is \"How do I get where I want to be?\". In order to answer that question, you need to know where that is.\n\nThere are many different reasons why someone would want to learn how to program and I feel like when the question of \"Where do I start?\" is asked, the response is never quite right.\n\nGenerally you see the same responses. Youtube, Code Camp, College but it's not really the answer you were looking for. You want to know how to create a piece of software. The first step to doing that is learning the basics of a programming language. Tutorials and books are a great [start](http:\/\/www.youtube.com) to doing this but just knowing the languages basic syntax isn't enough.\n\nWhen you finally get the basics of a language down you will have the skills you need to start a project. This includes knowing variables, conditions, loops, operators, data types, functions, classes and documentation. This process doesn't actually take very long, college classes usually take about two semesters to teach this but it can be [self-taught](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/) a lot quicker. When you get to this point you can start working on your first project.\n\nIn the process of creating your first project, whether it be a random number generator or a fully equipped web application, you will be researching and further teaching yourself what you need to know to finish. The process will be slow and at times frustrating but the next time you run into a similar problem, you'll know exactly what you need to do to fix it.\n\nThere is a possibility that your project won't turn out quite as imagined, but the entire process was a learning experience. When you choose to tackle your next projects you will then have those skills learned from the previous project to make the process a lot easier.\n\nAn important thing to note is that developers (and artists) will get overwhelmed trying to create every feature that they envisioned in their application at one time. There is a process to everything and you have to remember to take your time. Get something as close to what you want it to be on the screen. It can be extremely buggy and look terrible but if it's serving the function you created it to do you are on the right track. You can worry about the cosmetics later.\n\nAnother important note is that there are a ton of [resources](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/) to help ease this entire process. Linked throughout this post are a few. There are also a lot of different tools and platforms used to create these applications. It is all dependent on what you are trying to get done. If you wanted to create a dynamic web site you would want to learn HTML and CSS. If you wanted to add some advanced functionality to that website such as a user log in system, you would possible learn JavaScript and NodeJS. If you wanted to learn how to create video games you would more than likely learn a C language and use a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine. It is all extremely situational.\n\nFinally, i'd like to share the most important advice I've ever received in the field. That advice is: don't reinvent the wheel. If there is something you need to get done, chances are someone has done it for you and they are allowing you to use that in your software. An application is usually like a big puzzle that has been put together by the developer. For example: The popular video game \"Fortnite\" was created in the Unreal Engine mentioned above. They didn't go through and create their own engine with collision and artificial gravity from scratch. That would be expensive and a waste of time. They used a resource that was already available to them and added their own software and style to it and created one of the worlds most popular video games.\n\nI hope that this post helps people who are interested in getting into the computer science field or learning programming. It's a great skill to have and it can be extremely rewarding but it takes a lot of patience. Keep learning and working and eventually you will be where you want to be.\n\ntl;dr: Just dive into it. Start developing a product. Learn as you go\n\ntl;dr(2): practice makes perfect",

I would love to hear some of your advice to assist with my study since I'm a true beginner. In particular, I would like to have some textbook references, or list of subjects that are important for computer science, or any open course sources that can help me with my studies. Sadly to tell that I can't afford to enrolled in proper university, hence I choose to study by myself. Thank you in advance for your kindness. ",

   "description":"Hey everyone, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a HS Comp Sci and I have noticed that we have a serious problem in Computer Science education... at least at the high school level. Either students get a teacher that has little to no knowledge of programming, or they get a teacher that is a programmer, but not the skills to teach. Often times even if the teacher has programming and teaching abilities, a better job offer comes along to pay them more. The result is that the students suffer because great teachers aren't paid enough to hang around, especially in CS. Online tutorials are helpful, but that doesn't help the students with little CS experience or knowledge to pull from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that teachers get tons of days off and we are \"off\" around 3. But if you ask a teacher, they're days-off are often spent grading and lesson planning. The thought that we get off at 3 is ridiculous... And to prevent me from going in to a rant that nobody wants to listen to, I will leave it at that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is that I am frustrated that there isn't a bigger emphasis on CS education in general, more professional development incentives for teachers in CS, or some way to just get better CS teachers. I am not sure there is an easy answer to this, but wanted to know some thoughts and make people outside the CS education aware of this frightening fact when the future growth of CS is so immense.",

Fast forward seven years later, and I graduated with a degree in business with an emphasis on accounting. I attempted over 175 units with my share of failures and successes, including being on academic probation and on the Dean's List. If you have the opportunity to finish your degree, do it, it's totally worth the feeling.\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LXTfW84](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LXTfW84)",

I need to go and cook, but I will be back in a couple of hours to answer a few more.\n\n20:30 GMT EDIT: I think I will call this a day - it was really good talking and hearing opinions on the outbreak. Thank you for all the good wishes, they will be passed on. I genuinely hope that my opinions are wrong, and we will see our cases start to tail off- but the evidence we are seeing is to the contrary.

I am the type of guy who enjoys anime, comedy shows, action shows , cosplay, movie, and games and I lack passion because most of my life I just wanted to pay back my parents so making an idea that many people will use is difficult for me.\n\nHere are some ideas that I made but I'm honestly just putting anything out there and I don't know if I will be able to make it by the end of the summer while still spending time with family. \n\n1. Camping equipment website\n\n2. Scaling 3D models to correct proportions with various views\n\n3. Artwork website\n\n4. Auction website\\-sql, java\n\n5. Photo editor for mobile including cropping and texture editing\\-matlab, 2d library\n\n6. Discord add on\n\n7. Planting reminders for watering and weather forecast\n\n8. Mobile Quiz game\n\n9.

   "description":"Hi I've just started A-Level  Computer Science (UK) and we were learning how to represent negative numbers using twos compliment. Now what I don't get is that -127 would be 10000001. But how would a computer differentiate between that or the fact that in normal binary 10000001 would be 129? It's been nagging at the back of my mind for a while. A simple explanation would be appreciated. Thanks",

   "description":"Hey, I just wanted some recommendations as to what books or resources I should look into before heading off into my second year as a CS major. I've completed Intro to C++ 1 and 2 which is learning to program in C++ so I have experience in mostly dealing with just writing programs. Next quarter I will be delving into Discrete Structures which from my understanding is a logic class more than a CS focused class as well as Data Structures and Algorithms. It's notorious for being a weeder class so I would like to get a head start. I don't know where to look or how to differentiate good resources from bad. Links to where I can buy the books\/resources would be appreciated. Thanks!",

   "description":"Hello,\n\nI am a junior in CS, I'm looking to learn web development on the side so I have some practical coding experience.  I've been wanting to do this for a long time but there always seems to be too many resources to choose from and I just end up doing nothing because its too overwhelming.  I recently came across a deal on Udemy.com for C++ and Unreal 4, which lead me to see some courses listed as \"The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp\", or something similar.  I was about to purchase one because it was only $15, but I figured that might be stupid given that there is a ton of free resources on the internet.  I figure its time I pick one site and stick to it so that I can finally learn this.  These are the ones I'm looking at:\n\n* [Udemy Web Development Bootcamp](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/the-web-developer-bootcamp\/#curriculum)\n* [Udemy Web Developer Course w\/ Projects](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/web-developer-course\/)\n* [Free Code Camp](https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org)\n* [The Odin Project](https:\/\/www.theodinproject.com\/home)\n* [Code Academy](https:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/)\n* [University of Reddit](http:\/\/www.ureddit.com\/)\n\nCan anyone speak to their experiences with these? Is there one that stands out?  Should I just buy the Udemy course?  Any other suggestions are welcome too.  Thank you!\n\n",

   "description":"So, for my background knowledge - I recently graduated my high school. I learned C++ language in my junior and senior year. I guess, I can say that I learned basics of the language, eg. about OOP concepts, functions, Classes, Inheritance, Arrays, Queues, Stacks, implementation of all three using linked lists (where I'm still fuzzy), File handling (in text and binary files and their I\/O functions). \nI also put my hands on Java language in my sophomore year and learned easy-peasy concepts (which includes functions, classes and arrays only). We used the BlueJ platform to code in schools. I still feel like I learned no heavy or important stuff in that language. \nI'm not very keen in coding and computer science, in general. That comes from the fact that I always scored fair or low marks in my tests and felt like an idiot infront of bright kids. And I never did a project or built a software in my course (it was there but no one really cared for your real efforts). \nBut sometimes, I find myself getting excited to do a problem or think about a logic for a piece of code. From my high school experience, programming was both a good and bad experience. It was good because I developed methodical nature, procedural way of solving and diffused thinking. It was bad because I had to memorize a few code pieces for implementation of same kind of programs, low confidence due to constant failure in coming up with new or better logics and my poor\/slow typing skills (I am really ashamed of this in particular). \nNow, I want to expand and solidify my old concepts in Java and learn another language Python. I tried to look on EdX for a course, but there are so many for beginners. So I am confused about how and where to begin with. \nCan anyone please tell me more about this? I will also appreciate any other advices or criticisms. \nThanks a lot for reading this far :)",

   "description":"Hey all,\n\nI was wondering what the best way to learn algorithm analysis online. I go to a uni where our prof got fired a week before the final because of long story short, the man straight up neglected his duty to teach Algorithms properly (and that's a very charitable way of putting it). \n\nWith that being said, I still value my education enough to learn the content, and I don't intend on taking the class over again. So what are some of the best, concise resources on the internet I can use to study algorithms? I plan on doing this over the break which is about a month-long period. Thanks in advance!",

   "description":"I am searching for a good algorithm (better than O(N^2), N beeing the amount of edges)  to repeatedly check the shortest path between two nodes. \n\nThe Graph: \nI am using a grid like graph where i one after another add some edges. So the graph has about the same amount of edges and vertices and has no weight's nor is it directed. Before i add a new edge i want to check the distance between the 2 vertices i am Connecting and later decide on that result whether or not i want to add this Edge. \n\nMy question is, is there a Data structure that allows me to find the Distance between vertices in less then O(N^2) (wich would be just a BFS for the other Vertex)? That Data structure of course still needs to hold after i added a few edges. If possible i would like to have a space Complexity of O(N).\n\nIf you have any ideas i would really like to hear them.\n\n(The last thing i looked into was a disjoint set used in the Kruskal algorithm. With this i can check quickly whether two vertices are connected through a path or not)\n\nEdit:\nPractical Description of what i want to do:\n\nI am creating a dungeon generating algorithm that is based on Kruskall. You have a essentially Bool matrix wich says whether or not a Tile is walkable or not. Now i want that the algorithm creates cycles if they have a certain size. So if a add a new walkable tile i need to check whether or not i am creating a cycle and then check how long the cycle.",

   "description":"Hello guys, I came across a problem the other day, and actually got it wrong, this lead to interesting thing, the problem is write a function that returns either if a given sum can be acquired by summing some numbers in an array\/vector etc. or not\nAssume its sorted in ascending order. So some examples would be \nif the given array is \n1,1,4,5 and the sum is 9, it returns true\nalso if it is 1,1,2,3,5,11 and the sum is 10 it still returns true (problem originally asked only for a pair of integers)\nassume no negative numbers, the sum could be in the array in that case just return true. So I write a piece of code about this and seems to work (let me know if it doesn't I'm not totally sure) but I couldn't figure out it's time complexity, since it the number of iteration kind of affects the number of recursive steps, so anyway here is to code\n\nEDIT: good and helpful people found errors\/bugs in my code so I corrected them as best as I can but I'm still sure there are some, the question is though, still, what is the time complexity of this. Also, what do you think the worst case scenario for this algorithm\n\n    bool isThereSum(int* arr,int size, int sum){\n        static bool check = false;\n        if(check)\n            return false;\n        for(int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--){\n            if(arr[i] == sum)\n                return true;\n            else if(arr[i] < sum){\n                sum = sum - arr[i];\n                size--;\n                if(isThereSum(arr,size, sum));\n                    return true;\n                else\n                    sum = sum + arr[i];\n            }\n            if(size <= 0)\n                check = true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\nit works by crossing the largest number in the array smaller than the index, then looks for other number that can make it equal to sum, so if the array was 1,2,3,7,8,11 and the sum was 17, the sum would be 6, it would ignore 8 and 7, then the sum would be 3, then 1,then 0 and that would return true.

Outside the parking office is a table with envelopes and permit forms with a tear off copy for you to keep. The permit form link they gave online is slightly different from the forms they have on the table. Recommend just using the one provided at the table so you have a physical copy showing the date you dropped it off to avoid any refund amount mix-ups. Also the parking office won\u2019t process your permit for you in person. They are only receiving permits by mail or the drop off box. Deadline is this Wednesday for a refund of $142.50. Hope this helps!",

   "description":"In his 1974 article \"Computer science and its relation to mathematics\", Donald Knuth discusses whether computer science is a subfield of mathematics, or should be considered a mature field of its own. His mathematician friend tells him that he would consider computer science a worthwhile field of study as soon as it contains 1000 deep theorems. Knuth writes that perhaps only 50 have been discovered so far.\n\nNow, after 45 years, have we reached the milestone of 1000 deep results? What are these deep results?\n\nThe full quote from Knuth's article is below.\n\n\"One of my mathematician friends told me he would be willing to recognize computer science as a worthwhile field of study, as soon as it contains 1000 deep theorems. This criterion should obviously be changed to include algorithms as  well as theorems, say 500 deep theorems and 500 deep algorithms. But even so it is clear that computer science today does not measure up to such a test, if \"deep\" means that a brilliant person would need many months to discover the theorem or the algorithm. Computer science is still too young for this; I can claim youth as a handicap. We still do not know the best way to describe algorithms, to understand them or to prove them correct, to invent them, or to analyze their behavior, although considerable progress is being made on all these fronts. The potential for \"1000 deep results\" is there, but only perhaps 50 have been discovered so far.\"",

Every challenge is written in JS, which is IMO the best language for new programmers since it can easily be run and tested in the browser. I also recently wrote [this article about technical interview prep](https:\/\/www.algodaily.com\/lessons\/how-to-prepare-for-a-technical-interview) and [this article about how to approach technical interviews](https:\/\/www.algodaily.com\/lessons\/the-definitive-guide-to-approaching-tough-coding-interview-problems-when-blanking-out-or-stuck).\n\nI encourage you guys to check out the site and leave feedback. You're able to view 5 challenges before it prompts you to either accept ads or go premium. It would be greatly appreciated as I try to build a better resource for web developers who want to level up!",

   "description":"Just thought I'd share this little lesson I learned today - sometimes you program really clever things that are actually bad and redundant to your program. Don't be afraid to cut into it when necessary. \n\nMy program starts with a pre-load cache of a lot of data that the program will normally use, but just in case it uses something not yet loaded, I also wrote a small function that loads the missing data on-demand into the cache. Well everything worked but the program took about 25 seconds to load, which was annoying. I spent the whole day today trying to find clever ways to load the data faster - and came up with a bunch of possible solutions - the fastest of which was loading everything concurrently with threads.\n\nIt still was kind of slow. Just at the end of the day the solution came to me - I could delete all the pre-load nonsense and the \"cache on-demand\" will just do the work if and when it's needed. It worked perfectly. The loading time at the start went from 25 seconds to 2 seconds, and everything else was running perfectly (with a tiny lag here and there when data is being loaded for the first time). It only created one small bug that could be fixed by adding one line of code.\n\nAnyway, that's how I spent the whole day programming and ended up just removing lines.",

   "description":"Hello \/r\/python,\n\nPython for Scientists and Engineers was the first book I wrote, and the one I still get queries about.  It had been out of print for more than a year, but I could never get myself to update it, because it looked like too much work.\n\nRecently, I asked for help in updating it, and a few people volunteered. Thanks to these volunteers, the book is now free to read online (and will remain so). \n\nThe book assumes you already know Python, or any other language. I feel there are too many resources for beginners, and not enough for intermediate\/advanced programmers.\n\nAnyway, check it out here:\n\n[http:\/\/pythonforengineers.com\/python-for-scientists-and-engineers\/](http:\/\/pythonforengineers.com\/python-for-scientists-and-engineers\/)\n\nCheers,\nShantnu \n\n\n\n\n",

   "description":"I don't know why but the math was never that hard. And up to date structures, I was fine. Maybe since my DS course was in Java and my Prof was more concerned about GUI aspect of the program over the actual DS. However, after transferring to uni from my community college. I've been face first on a lot of my coding assignment. Takes me forever to knock out the code out and I would get low grades. Top it off, this is my third time taking systems programming. My first semester, I just gave up in that course. The second semester I buckled down and still failed due to the exams being 100% code based pen and paper exams. In my mathematics courses, I've done well, actually pursuing my minor in mathematics. So how do I get over this death by code? I can talk about the problem. Figure it how to do it( in theory), but when it comes to coding. I become a zen master...my mind goes blank.\n\nThings I've tried. \nBought intro\/ crash course style books. Complete most of them. \nWould try r\/ dailyprogramming exercises and cry myself into a ball. \n\nLast bit. I'm too far to turn back. I'm 3 core classes away from completing my major requirements. One of which is systems and the other I'm taking right now. All I would need are electives and programming languages. Since my concentration is in data science, all my electives will be what I need to gain my concentration. So I only need 7 more classes assuming I pass everything this semester. \n\nAny ideas? I will check this after my classes today around 1500 us mountain time. Thanks.\n\nEdit 1: spelling and grammar. Stupid cell phone, you make me look bad. Along with....\n\nThank you everyone who has responded, a lot of well-thought-out comments and ideas. A lot of which boils down to practice and exposure. Which is true, I have not had enough of either in the coding world. So I will have to work on that by working on some fun stuff. I'm thinking a magic mirror would be a fun project. Thank you all again. I won't be deleting this as someone else might find this useful. ",

To be honest I don't really understand any of theories and I can't really program any data structures. What should I know? Today I just realized I don't really care or take any of my classes serious. I'm not doing the best, but I'm not failing either. I want to be more involved in what we are learning. Many of the classes I'm in are based on previous information, but I never understood it. So I would like to improve to actually be a computer scientist instead of just getting a degree and not knowing anything.",

I\u2019m a first-year college student studying CS and I\u2019ve taken a few CS courses so far, enough that I know at least SOMETHING. But despite this, I have no idea how to start making things. Doing it on my own is hard and there\u2019s no way for me to join project-based clubs at school because they\u2019re competitive as fuck and have more stages of interviews than a real company lmao. \n\nI feel like I know enough to do something with programming, but how? I mean, I suppose I can create really lame shit on a command line, but that\u2019s about it. I\u2019ve tried looking into GUIs and it\u2019s just so confusing.

   "description":"So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.\n\nI\u2019m have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.\n\nWhether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.\n\nIf you prefer video format, here\u2019s a video I made covering these topics:\n\nYouTube channel: Matt Upham\n\nVideo: How to get a software engineering internship in 2019\n\nThe first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.\n\nThe second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \\[Insert college here\\], and then use people filters such as 1st \/2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.\n\nThe best people in your network to reach out to are:\n\n\\- College \/ coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at\n\n\\- Friends \/ classmates who interned at that company\n\n\\- Professors \/ mentors who might have connections with that company\n\n\\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - \u201cfriends of friends who worked at \\[X company\\]\n\nThe next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don\u2019t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples\u2019 work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you\u2019ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nHi \\[person\u2019s name\\]!\n\nMy name is \\[your name\\], and I\u2019m an  \\[type of engineer\\]  in \\[location\\].\n\nI\u2019m reaching out because I applied to \\[company\\] regarding your \\[position\\].\n\nI have experience with \\[this technology, skill, etc\\]\n\nFollowing up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.\n\nWould someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \\[insert date to add time pressure\\]?\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\\[Your name\\]\n\n\\[Phone number\\]\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nFollowing up after they\u2019ve responded:\n\nWould you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\\[Your name\\]\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThe most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don\u2019t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.\n\nIf you\u2019ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them \u201cHow can I stand out in the intern application process for \\[X\\] company?\u201d, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you\u2019d be a good fit.\n\nAnother way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn\u2019t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:\n\n\\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)\n\n\\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience\/projects section\n\n\\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)\n\n\\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them\n\nThe next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you\u2019ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won\u2019t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you\u2019ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you\u2019re ready to go because you know you prepared!\n\nThe final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There\u2019s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!\n\nI customized the funnel by tracking:\n\n1. Company Name\n2. Position Name\n3. Contact Name\n4. Contact Email\n5. Contact LinkedIn\n6. Date of Last Contact\n7. Job Source\n8. Job Posting URL\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet\/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!\n\nThe job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That\u2019s what will ultimately start you on your journey.",

We shouldn't have to feel a sense of unease in a place of learning, but I guess that's just the sad reality of our society. \n\nI've helped to make a petition with suggestions for how we can improve upon the security of parking areas in specific since these recent events have occurred in those areas. I haven't seen much of a surveillance system in the structures and that is alarming. My hope is that we'll be able to take this to the administration as a valid and unified suggestion. It may or may not work but I feel some action needs to be taken. \n\n[Link to petition](http:\/\/chng.it\/bw2kVqn7)\n\nIf anyone else has suggestions please post them here so we can add to it.\nThanks all and stay safe",

I came here to talk something about CS in college with you.\n\nIn China, Bachelor scholar students learn the fundamental courses such as: C\/C++ language, Java, C#, computer architecture, data structure, computer network, operating system, compiler, database and so on. Most of us don't have any pre-knowledge before we start college as we have to prepare for the national college entrance exam which is the same as SAT in USA (some students in Peking University and Tsinghua  University may already acquire the ability of coding in ACM competition though). Except from courses, we mostly do some competitions or researches with teammates and teachers to improve our ability.\n\nWe all know some legendary students in US such as Mark Zuckerberg who started his own company in college and raised a technology empire, but what would normal US bachelor students do mostly? what would you like to do after you get your first degree?",

I am already feeling much more comfortable about what I am getting myself into, and I am going to try to learn a bit about Python during my free time. I just did a few modules on codecademy, and it seems pretty enjoyable so far!",

   "description":"Today my coworker asked me to help him with something.  Basically, we had a bunch of gift cards that were supposed to be for employee giveaways, but they were all about to expire. We had about 100 of them.  These gift cards were only redeemable as a guest user so we couldn't just log in to the website and load them all into one user.  We had to perform a separate order for every single gift card.  The worst part is none of the form data was saving in my browser either, so I had to fill in the shipping information manually.  The whole order process took 5 minutes per card.  If done manually, that is..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've never used selenium before but I figured this was literally the perfect task, since the orders were all the same save for the gift card codes.  I told my coworker to just help me type out all the codes into a text file and told him I would take it from there.  20 minutes later I had written up a selenium script that ran through the list of codes and performed the orders.  I let the script run for about 15 minutes and we were done!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEasily a 2 hour task for two people done in 40 minutes by one! Thanks python.",

While recovering, I realised I wasn't doing what I really wanted to be doing. So I'm about to take on a certificate in Computer Science & IT at Open Uni, with a view to working on a degree in software development. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips or advice?\n\nE.g. handy kit or apps to practice with. I've been working with a Mac for several years too (don't hate on me for it!), so I need a PC again. I'd like something that can handle all my needs, but I'd prefer to keep costs to a minimum as I'm also buying a house this year. \n\nThanks in advance. ",

   "description":"I took an intro to computer networking class. We learned about the basics of protocols and even did some socket programming. But the main issue I'm having is how are these protocols implemented? \n\nLike, where\/what is the code that lets the sender know when to send bits, what to do when ACK received out of order, congestion control, and the such? Where is this code implemented? Is it in a language like C? Assembly? How does one \"edit\" this code (in theory; I'm sure it's very difficult to actually edit the code). \n\nIs the code for the protocol itself inside our routers? Is it in the computers? I really don't understand. Another question, one of our first assignments was to have a host and client server, and just have the host send the client a message using sockets. At no point in this assignment did I see any TCP implementation other than listening for the host and getting a handshake. In this case, was there TCP inbetween sending the message between host and client?\n\nSorry if this is a terribly dumb question, but it's really bothering me and I'm terribly confused probably confusing myself more.",

   "description":"I'm a recent graduate of CSUF. As I sit here in the bathroom of my town home gingerly unloading on my toilet I thought \"what wisdom do I have to pass on to current students at CSUF?\"\n\nThe answer is pooping. I pooped a LOT at CSUF and I'm not one to repeat the same action without a dusting of innovation each time. Here's my quick guide:\n\nPooping at the TSU:\nWhilst dumping at the student union, you must go to the bathroom with the least traffic. Remember - people eat shitty here AND beer is served downstairs. Avoid those. The bathroom in the courtyard is also high traffic. I'd you're really verbal like me avoid those.  My choice is the bathrooms towards the back near the conference rooms \/ auditorium dealies. These bathrooms are down a hallway on the SW side of the TSU. Only drawback? Bad reception. But read for fucks sake! You're in college. \n\nPooping at College Park:\nThis is truly a way to dump in style. Not only are the bathrooms roomy, the equipment is top notch AND the wifi signal is good! My pro tip is to pick a floor that's mostly administrative faculty. You don't want one professors are on. I believe 4 was my old favorite, but don't quote me on that. You'll find lots of room to spread out here in the disabled stall (or the suite a I call it) with a nice hook to hang your backpack. It's worth the walk. \n\nOther buildings on campus:\nSince I covered the opposite bases of CP and TSU, I figured I should tell you about my middle ground. When I had classes in other buildings but had enough time poop between, I'd hit the library for a vintage poop. For a spooky surprise, hit the top floor of the taller building! The lights will usually be off in half the place but the bathrooms are always well lit! Because they're mostly old equipment, be prepared for some cool mod colors in the bathroom and smaller butt-area on the actual unit. Take a trip into the 70s when you latch the door and pretend you were a hippie pinching one off at the man's library. \n\nI hope this is able to help some folks have a better time on the John - keep that iPhone handy and remember! Always always check the paper supply before you let one fly. ",

I'm often stumbling over a piece of information, a link, a picture, a text snippet and I've no clue where to put it in an organized manner. How are you people keeping that stuff organized? I know, not a classical computer science topic but I thought that the main intention of snippet organization would be sufficient to give it a try around here.\n\nThanks a lot!",

We're reading the screen by taking screenshots with pywin32, seeing about 20 FPS with the neural network, sending keys with direct input, and then doing some analysis with OpenCV, otherwise also training with a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. \n\nThe goal of the series is more to show you how you can take just about whatever game you want, mapping the screen to inputs, training a neural network, and then letting the network play the game. \n\nIt's an ongoing project, and is also **[open-source](https:\/\/github.com\/sentdex\/pygta5\/)**\n\nHere's a link to the **[self-driving tutorials](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v\/)**, which starts at the beginning. We start to use the neural network in **[part 9](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/self-driving-car-neural-network-training-data-python-plays-gta-v\/)**\n\nThat's all for now, more AI in GTA to come.",

Like I don't get how to determine asymptotic RT like Theta(n) outside of cases like N or N^2. \n\nI had a similar experience in Discrete Math last quarter, proof by induction just didn't seem intuitive and really never stuck with me, I fear the same will happen in this class too.

   "description":"Literally any advice is greatly appreciated, and if there is a better place to ask please point me that way. I was accepted to the Masters of Science in Data Science program at Harvard and to the Masters of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, and I am trying to decide where to go.\n\nAt Georgia Tech I could have a concentration in Machine Learning so the courses I would take wouldn't be too significantly different between the two places. It seemed like Harvard had some more pure statistics classes but this isn't a problem to me as I enjoy stats. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing in terms of post-graduate opportunities. I plan to get a job after graduating instead of continuing to a PhD immediately. I may return eventually but a PhD wouldn't be my immediate goal.\n\nThe program at Harvard is new. I would only be the second year accepted to it, so I don't really know if this is a good or bad thing. I can't expect it would be bad as it's Harvard. I do wonder if Georgia Tech's program that has been around for longer than just two years might be more known and respected than this new program at Harvard. But at the same time everyone has heard of Harvard and knows it is a great school.\n\nIn terms of rankings, Georgia Tech is #8 and Harvard is #16 in the US News and World Report rankings for graduate computer science. I'm not sure how important the name of Harvard is or the #8 ranking of Georgia Tech is to potential employers. I'm sure either school would be great and will open many doors for me, but I'm just looking for any advice or insight or anyone that has any experience with either school.",

Rapes, stabbings, suicides, and bringing a gun to the parking structure have been less acknowledged by the school then some stupid dude writing the N word on a poster. I barley found out about the professor killing himself today when it happened 2 weeks ago, yet I get spammed on my emails from top people of the school because someone wrote the N word somewhere? For most of the stuff like the suicide and the gun being brought on campus I had to find out through other people. It\u2019s kinda stupid what is being brought into light and what isn\u2019t.",

   "description":"\"Hamilton's work prevented an abort of the Apollo 11 moon landing:[3] Three minutes before the Lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. The computer was overloaded with incoming data, because the rendezvous radar system (not necessary for landing) updated an involuntary counter in the computer, which stole cycles from the computer. Due to its robust architecture, the computer was able to keep running; the Apollo onboard flight software was developed using an asynchronous executive so that higher priority jobs (important for landing) could interrupt lower priority jobs. Initially, the fault had been attributed to a faulty checklist and the radar being erroneously activated by the crew, but a 2005 re-analysis concluded that a hardware design error in the rendezvous radar provided the computer with faulty information even while in standby mode.[9]\n\nDue to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.\"\n\n\u2014Margaret Hamilton, Letter to Datamation, March 1, 1971[10]",

   "description":"# JustPy\n\n[JustPy Docs and Tutorials](https:\/\/justpy.io)\n\n## Introduction\n\nJustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming.\n\nUnlike other web frameworks, JustPy has no front-end\/back-end distinction. All programming is done on the back-end allowing a simpler, more productive, and more Pythonic web development experience. JustPy removes the front-end\/back-end distinction by intercepting the relevant events on the front-end and sending them to the back-end to be processed.\n\nIn JustPy, elements on the web page are instances of component classes. A component in JustPy is a Python class that allows you to instantiate reusable custom elements whose functionality and design is encapsulated away from the rest of your code.\n\nCustom components can be created using other components as building blocks. Out of the box, JustPy comes with support for [HTML](https:\/\/justpy.io\/#\/tutorial\/html_components) and [SVG](https:\/\/justpy.io\/#\/tutorial\/svg_components) components as well as more complex components such as [charts](https:\/\/justpy.io\/#\/charts_tutorial\/introduction) and [grids](https:\/\/justpy.io\/#\/grids_tutorial\/introduction).  It also supports most of the components and the functionality of the [Quasar](https:\/\/quasar.dev\/) library of [Material Design 2.0](https:\/\/material.io\/) components.\n\nJustPy encourages creating your own components and reusing them in different projects (and, if applicable, sharing these components with others).\n\nJustPy supports visualization using [matplotlib](https:\/\/justpy.io\/#\/tutorial\/matplotlib) and [Highcharts](https:\/\/justpy.io\/#\/charts_tutorial\/introduction).\n\nJustPy integrates nicely with [pandas](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/) and simplifies building web sites based on pandas analysis. JustPy comes with a [pandas extension](https:\/\/justpy.io\/#\/charts_tutorial\/pandas?id=using-the-pandas-extension) that makes it simple to create interactive charts and grids from pandas data structures.\n\nFor updates and news please follow the [JustPy Twitter account](https:\/\/twitter.com\/justpyframework)\n\n## Hello World!\n\n    import justpy as jp\n    \n    def hello_world():\n        wp = jp.WebPage()\n        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')\n        wp.add(d)\n        return wp\n        \n    jp.justpy(hello_world)\n\nThe program above activates a web server that returns a web page with 'Hello world!' for any request. Locally, you would direct your browser to [http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8000](http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8000) or http:\/\/localhost:8000\/ or  to see the result.\n\nHere is a slightly modified version in which 'Hello world!' changes to 'I was clicked!' when it is clicked.\n\n    import justpy as jp\n    \n    def my_click(self, msg):\n        self.text = 'I was clicked!'\n    \n    def hello_world():\n        wp = jp.WebPage()\n        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')\n        d.on('click', my_click)\n        wp.add(d)\n        return wp\n    \n    jp.justpy(hello_world)\n\nMany other examples can be found in the [tutorial](https:\/\/justpy.io\/#\/tutorial\/getting_started)\n\n## Under the Hood\n\nJustPy's backend is built using:\n\n* [starlette](https:\/\/www.starlette.io\/) \\- \"a lightweight [ASGI](https:\/\/asgi.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/) framework\/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services\".\n* [uvicorn](https:\/\/www.uvicorn.org\/) \\- \"a lightning-fast [ASGI](https:\/\/asgi.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/) server, built on [uvloop](https:\/\/github.com\/MagicStack\/uvloop) and [httptools](https:\/\/github.com\/MagicStack\/httptools)\".\n\nJustPy's frontend (which is transparent to JustPy developers) is built using:\n\n* [Vue.js](https:\/\/vuejs.org\/) \\- \"The Progressive JavaScript Framework\"\n\nThe way JustPy removes the frontend\/backend distinction is by intercepting the relevant events on the frontend and sending them to the backend to be processed.\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0.txt)",

   "description":"I (f,18) am a senior in high school hoping to pursue a career in CS.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, there was a substitute in for my Calculus teacher. He began talking to me about college and what I wanted to study. I said I was very interested in CS and programming. \n\nHe says to me, \u201cCS is a very difficult major. I don\u2019t know many females who make it through all four years.\u201d\n\nI was dumbfounded. I did not say another word, but I wish I would have. How could you say that to an aspiring student? I would love to have another chance to chew this guy out. \n\nI knew I wanted to be a CS major since freshman year, and I\u2019m not going to let some misogynistic loser tell me that I don\u2019t have a good chance succeeding in my dream because of my gender. \n\n\nFor some more context, this guy graduated with a mechanical engineering degree. I don\u2019t know how he has any room to talk about the difficulty of CS.\n\n\nEdit: For those of you who think I made this story up: what would I possibly gain out of that? I had an encounter with an asshole and wanted to share it because I know it (sadly) is a common problem in the CS community.",

   "description":"I'm building a website to explain math. It will use text, video, and interactive randomly generated exercises. So there will be video of me explaining and solving problems, with accompanying text in the web page. Then there will be a place to click for an automatically, randomly generated exercise. You can click to get as many as you want.\n\n\nI know basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of compliers and interpreters. I think with a medium amount of struggle I can build a JS parser to build and read expressions.\n\n\nThe material will span algebra, geometry, calculus, discrete math, physics, etc. Lots of different kinds of rendering is needed. Ultimately this will expand to very advanced subjects like measure theory and quantum mechanics. So you can imagine what goes into automatically and randomly generating both algebra expressions and geometry diagrams, and then more. It's going to have to use something like LaTeX, Geogebra, maybe both, maybe something else.\n\n\nI've been handling the text with MathJax, but that can't do geometry diagrams. I could generate the diagrams in a separate software, but then that can't be embedded in the page so the user can generate them on-demand. I started looking at LaTeX.js but the diagrams don't render as expected and there's minimal documentation of this. The code is open source but I'm not proficient enough to be able to understand it.\u00a0\n\n\nNow I'm willing to spend years studying CS to figure this out. In fact I'm currently studying computer architecture and will soon study operating systems and network science. So it's no problem for me to devote a lot of time seriously and methodically learning what I need in order to do this project. I just don't know what I need to learn. \u2026 Browsers? JavaScript graphics or animation? What topic or book, or whatever, should I be learning? If no tool exists that can do what I need, what do I need to learn in order to build my own? I'd appreciate anyone just pointing me in the right direction.\n\n\nThanks for any help!\n\nNote: Particularly helpful would be textbook titles, college course titles, links to web resources, or a search string I could enter into Amazon.",

   "description":"Hello fellow redditors!\n\nMe and my friend have been given an assignment in our Computer Science course at uni to give a short presentation (\\~15 minutes) about Surveillance Capitalism. We have largely based the explaining about what it is from either Shoshana Zuboffs book \"The age of Surveillance Capitalism\" and different articles regarding the issue, and it can most easily be explained as: \n\n\"Surveillance capitalism describes a market-driven process where the commodity for sale is your personal data, and the capture and production of this data relies on mass surveillance of the internet. This activity is often carried out by companies that provide us with free online services, such as search engines and social media platforms.\"\n\nIn the last part of our presentation, we are to give our predictions for how this process will develop in the future. It can focus on things like how states\/countries\/unions might legislate and regulate to keep it under control (i.e. GDPR in the European Union) or how companies can develop more sophisticated methods to extract and sell the data more efficiently.  \n\nMy question is what you guys might think about future development regarding this issue? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

There's also a [dark theme](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BGUqHM2.png)!\n\nIt can also do things you would _not_ expect, because it's in beta and may have bugs. Submit an issue on GitHub if you find one of those!\n\nThis is my first released project of any kind, so any feedback is welcome.",

   "description":"Hey there!\n\nI am a first computer science student and I've been doing a lot of research in machine learning and AI. I find it interesting and maybe a prospective field of study. Unfortunately, the machine learning classes at my university are still a year off of where I am.\n\nI've currently taken an intro CS class and data structures. I'm starting into systems now. I am proficient in C, C++, and Python.\n\nI was wondering, what's the best way to get started learning this stuff on my own? There are a few guides on Python ML online, but they mostly use libraries that I don't know, and I find myself just copying and pasting what they have. I'd like to work from the ground up, so I can actually see what's going into all of this.\n\nFor example, I saw a demo of a guy who set up a program to play Super Mario World on its own, taking inputs, playing the level, learning where it dies and what it takes to get past it. He somewhat explained the neural network, but it's still conceptually ambiguous to me, because I don't know what's going on at a base level.\n\nDoes anyone have any resources or tips to get me into ML at a very basic level? Any help is greatly appreciated!",

   "description":"So I am going into my sophomore year of college this coming fall, I\u2019m majoring in computer science and I can\u2019t help but feel behind?\n\nSo far all i\u2019ve learned is just basic python, but I don\u2019t feel like I have enough resources to apply to any internships yet, or even come up with mini projects for myself. Does anyone have any idea on how to get more involved? \n\nAlso, I do not know if this makes a difference, but in the long run I\u2019d like to work with AI so if anyone knows how to get started in that, that\u2019d help a ton.\n\nThanks,\n- a confused comsci noob",

I have a near-4.0 GPA as a comp sci major in my junior year now. I applied to many companies and have gotten rejected from all the big names, which considering how hard I\u2019ve worked in school id really want to work for one of these companies. I have never even had an in person interview yet because I never make it past the online assessment. I own cracking the coding interview and have done some problems and leetcode as well but it\u2019s really hard for me to work under a rigid clock that if I don\u2019t submit something working 100% before the clock runs out, I\u2019m given a robotic rejection email. Has anyone gone through\/overcame this experience or similar? Any advice on how to exactly prepare for those questions? I hope my investment in college is going to a good cause. Thanks!",

I have some knowledge in programming, like Java and Python languages (currently I work in company at junior position).

Intro to CS - Computer Science An Overview\n2. Hardware - The Elements of Computer Systems (Nand2Tetris) \/ Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond\n3. OS - Operating Systems Principles and Practice\n4. Compilers - Engineering a Compiler\n5. Sedgewick Algorithms\n6. Computer Networking A Top Down Approach\n7. Distributed systems (need advice)\n8. ...\n\nAre these a  good books? If you have any remarks\/suggestions, please write. Also, if you already read these books, you may write some reviews. Thanks.",

   "community_name":"csuf",
   "url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csuf\/comments\/bomx47\/finishing_my_first_semester_in_mba_program\/",
   "description":"Hi guys,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to share some thoughts I had about my experience during my first semester as an MBA student - some things I liked and some things I didn't like. If this impacts at least one person I'll be satisfied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been out of school for a few years. I went back mostly because I hate my job, and I needed something to distract me from my pain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe two classes I took (not going to mention, don't ask) presented a fairly steep learning curve - as a Statistics undergrad with no business class experience, I have no knowledge of accounting principles or business jargon. Nearly every assignment is filled with acronyms and financial statements that I had to look up the meaning of online, and nearly continuously referring to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring case report discussions, I came to realize that the optimal way of presenting information is similar to a TED talk - be engaging, have simple speech, and be extremely comfortable speaking confidently to a large group. Substance matters after these.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a really wide variance in how difficult the classes can be - some classes you are yawning and wondering if this was worth your money, the next has you scraping the bucket for every last second to spend on an assignment that \"has no right answer\". The last few weeks of this semester I took vacation days from work to spend extra time doing homework. Granted, I am extremely thorough and put a lot of time into my assignments, but I want to get the most bang for my buck here - I don't want to leave any effort on the table.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorking full time and taking classes will cause you to seriously evaluate how you spend your time. I generally go to the gym three times per week, but during this semester at most I could go once per week and sometimes there were multiple weeks where I could not go at all. I made up for this lack of time by going onto the ketogenic diet and walking more at work. I also had to shelve all the books I was reading\/listening to through audible so I could focus on reading the course materials. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found that I was leading two lives - me at work and me at school. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe at work is a nobody - a low level analyst for a team that does unimportant work for a company that doesn't need us. I've been here for almost three years and have come to understand how little I matter on a macro or micro level. All of the things I tried to break out of that mold - failure. I'm not saying I wasn't deserving of failure, but trying to increase engagement and reduce turnover in a place where that isn't encouraged should at least be recognized as important work. I will always remember the organizational inflexibility, highly structured hierarchy, lack of care for employees, lack of idea implementation, and lack of vision for the future, and for that I am grateful. These memories will never leave me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe at school is an impactful person. I had an idea that went to the top of the college and was implemented nearly immediately. I was suggested to be the initial speaker for a group of clients due to the energy and storytelling ability I bring to the podium. I hold this as a great accomplishment because when I first started I could not clearly articulate one sentence. I have been able to do so due to the effort and care of my classmates, professor, and school culture. Without that environment I would not succeed, and for that I am grateful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy classmates ran the spectrum from disappointing to enthralling. Some people had finished their undergraduate degree and jumped straight into the MBA program without work experience, and it showed. Some people were business owners and using this experience to level up and recruit for their business at the same time. Still others were in the corporate world and looking to move up amid juggling family and work obligations. I've learned something from each of these people, and for that opportunity I am grateful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn another way, my classmates were supremely disappointing. There tends to be a mixture of tenure within the classes, and inside one group there were people who were just about to graduate. It soon became clear to me that their interest level in the class dropped early and dropped hard, and it was all they could muster to meet the lower requirements. I recall repeatedly venting my frustrations to my wife - 'If you've been here for two years, why wouldn't you take care of and help out the newer people?! Why wouldn't you mentor them in the same that you wish your company mentored you?!? Why wouldn't you finish as strongly as possible, as opposed to weakly walking across the finish line?!?\" Should I continue with the program, I will fix this. I'm extremely grateful for being in a situation that gave me this idea. I will work very hard to make it successful, should I continue with the program. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI learned that an MBA program probably isn't worth it. Sure you're learning things, but I was learning well on my own before I started going back to school. Arguably, I could get a part time job for one day a week in sales and end up with more money and a more applicable education after one year. I still may actually pursue this route - I'm going to attend for one more semester and see how I feel at the end of it. Thinking that I will have to keep going for another 2 years is disheartening, and paying $30K for the privilege of losing nearly all my free time is even more so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is already way longer than I meant it to be, but it's a good start I think. Thanks for sticking with me.",

I'm a junior and have finished all my basic CS and CE classes and am now going to focus on a concentration however im not sure which to pursue. To give you an idea of my options, they are:\n\nComputational Theory\n\nCyber Security Science\n\nData Science\n\nGame and Simulation Programming\n\nNetworking\n\nPervasive Computing\n\nSoftware Engineering\n\nI was thinking about pursuing cyber security however I am not sure if that is a highly competitive field that I may have trouble getting into? I'm like a middle of the pack student so I will struggle to get a 3.0. In terms of what I want to do the most for enjoyment it would be game and simulation programming however that seems like the most difficult career path to get into. What are your recommendations?",

The other girls are seniors, so I'm pretty lonely in the class. \n\nAnyway, taking this class, and getting 100 on every assignment, has made me want to become a computer scientist; specifically a software engineer. I plan on taking AP comp sci next year.\n\nFor some reason I just love programming so so much. It just makes sense. It clicks. Even when I'm not near a computer, I'm writing code on napkins or in the margins of my notebooks or just thinking of how to fix a bug and be anxious to fix it.\n\nI just wanted to hear any opinions or any advice or recommendations. My dream school is MIT or Carnegie Mellon  (of course) but I was just curious to hear others thoughts. \n\nThanks!",

Or maybe do you offer any advice on how we could do something like this. The game seems simple and looks like something made with Scratch. But I don't know how data collecting would be done. Also is there like a published research of what he did or just like anything that would help.\n\nSo please, any help would be appreciated\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)",

   "description":"I'm going to check on Khan Academy after this, and I know that I should extinguish all of my sources before I post this, but I would like more sources regardless.\n\nI cannot seem to suggest good\/any algorithms for problems that come up in my class or in chapter 1 of my professor's textbook. I'm definitely lacking something, but can someone provide me with a good source so that I can get around that? The textbook I've been using (that isn't my professor's) is _Introduction to Algoritms_ by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. I've read through only the first ~110 pages, but I feel like it just teaches how to solve stuff optimally rather than how to try and fit something to an arbitrary runtime.\n\nI'll provide a couple of examples regarding stuff that I don't even know how to approach. I'm not asking for solutions for these, but just sources that I can look at to tell me how to start dissecting these on my own:\n\n1) We're in a building _n_ floors tall, and we have _k_ students. We want to find the lowest floor such that if a student jumps off then they die. The only way to test this is to have a student jump off. If student _i_ jumps and lives, student _i_ is the next to jump; if not, then student _i+1_ is up next. Assuming that _k < ceil(log_2 n)_, **propose an algorithm that runs in O(k + n \/ 2^(k-1)) time**.\n\n2) For any string S containing only 0's and 1's, a string is _balanced_ if the number of 0's equals the number of 1's. Propose an algorithm to find the maximum balanced sub-string in **a) O(n^2) time, b) in O(n) time.**\n\n\n____________\nThank you very much. I hope to get better, as I'm struggling in all of my classes. I'll probably be posting on here often, unless if this isn't the right sub for this.\n\nSincerely,\n\nnoobto",

   "description":"I've come to realization that I've gotten through the majority of my education by sheer memorization and practice. Now that I'm pursuing my BSCS, my studying habits and more importantly my logic, just isn't cutting it. \n\n\nI'm currently taking Discrete Math and Data Structures\/Algorithms, and I'm struggling to understand the material. Not only that, but I'm also having trouble recreating the logic during exams. I'm starting to feel like I'm just terrible at math and logic. \n\n\nI can genuinely say that it is not my effort that's holding me back because I spend an enormous amount of time studying, which is what I think bothers me the most. \n\n\nHopefully there are some of you out there who struggled with certain subjects and were able to overcome that through changing a habit. So I come to you humbled, asking for any and all input. \nHow do I approach the subject, how do I absorb the material better, etc. \n\n\nEDIT: wow.. Thank you for all of the responses, genuinely thank you! You guys helped me take a deep breathe, and I'll definitely be trying to incorporate some of your guys' advice. \n",

   "description":"Hey guys -\n\nI\u2019m a sophomore majoring in computer science. I originally came to my university as an MIS major, but disliked the heavy business emphasis and wanted to learn coding more anyways, so this was my first semester in CS.\n\nI\u2019m currently in Computer Org and Intro to Computing. I\u2019m barely passing Computer Org (I think he\u2019s curving, however, I just really don\u2019t understand anything in the class) and I have 97% A in Intro to Computing.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve earned my A. I\u2019ve needed help from the teachers assistant and my lab and lecture profs to attain that grade thus far. I somehow managed to get an A- on my midterm exam even though I couldn\u2019t finish 2 of the 4-5 programs on the test because my mind went blank. \n\nTonight, I was doing another assignment related to sorting a text file and decrypting it and such and I was only able to finish it because I asked my prof for help and he sent me some stuff he went over in virtual lecture more in depth. \n\nI just feel really stupid. The girl I work with all the time in lab seems to grasp it more quickly than me a lot and she\u2019s not even majoring in CS. Sometimes I can work on a problem for days and nights and not figure it out. I really want to succeed and do this but I\u2019m getting really worried. I was never a strong math student in HS and in college I\u2019ve done acceptable but I\u2019m not a wizard by any means.\n\nI just find myself questioning a lot if I\u2019m really doing the right thing. I have really severe depression and anxiety so every time I can\u2019t solve something or mess up, I automatically assume I\u2019m a dumbass and I should just crawl back to IT because that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be good for and I\u2019m a joke for even thinking I could major in CS and learn a programming language.\n\nI just guess I want to know if my feelings are valid, if I should really be worried like I am or if it\u2019s just my poor mental state messing with my head, or what. When I get things right, they usually go great and I feel happy and like I\u2019m successful. When they go bad, I rethink my entire life and major. I\u2019m planning on taking Data Structures and Discrete Structures next sem and I\u2019m honestly pretty freaked out because I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re hard - I have to take calc at some point to even graduate and I\u2019m practically having anxiety just thinking about that. \n\nSorry, I know this post was kinda long and ranty but I just got done with that assignment and needed to dump some stuff off my chest. I just don\u2019t feel super smart like a lot of the people in my classes and I feel stupid that I need help a lot (sometimes, simple things that I barely messed up, like putting a print statement in the wrong place - sometimes I need better explanation and some starting points). I guess I just wanted to hear from some of the rest of you about your experiences with these feelings and how you overcame them or something like that. \n\nThanks for reading my long winded post and taking the time to answer if you do :)",

   "description":"I am an incoming sophomore this year. I went into college with no prior experience or any knowledge about computer science but since i didn't know what i wanted to do, I thought it would be an okay start. I took the introductory class and I ended up liking it alot and having alot of fun. I grasped alot of the concepts they try to teach in the class pretty well. But, I still feel like I'm in a race i'll never have a chance of winning. My friend who inspired me to join this field made me feel very small. He said that it's extremely competitive in this field which is why you need to make yourself stand out. He programmed for 5 years before college and this past summer he was involved in research for the university in the field. I feel so behind him and I wonder how things will go. I really don't know much about this field. I know people need to have personal projects and internships but I don't have either of those. I'm pretty creative and I'm sure I can definitely think of projects but I don't know how to even start. My friend has pretty cool projects and I don't even know where to start to get to that point. I'm so lost right now and I'm hoping someone can clear up some of this for me. It seems like the journey to an entry level job in programming is super complicated as well as competitive. They don't inform any of this stuff in school so I have no idea where to get information for stuff like this.",

As a way to try to make some side income I tried being a mock interviewer with Gainlo for a short while.\n\n---\n\n# My Experience w\/ Gainlo\n\nI was an interviewer for this company\/guy for a couple of weeks to test the waters, see how it operates, and if it was legitimate. The appeal of Gainlo is supposed to be that your interviewers are FANG engineers and get risk-free feedback. The person\/group behind Gainlo, [\"Jake\"](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jake-cook-259bab101\/), acts as the middle-man and matchmaker for candidates and charges $250+.\n\nThere were 4 main problems with this:\n\n1. **Inconsistent\/Low quality interviewers:** A friend was quoted $225 for an entry-level interview by Jake. For perspective, I was paid $50\/hr after negotiating. I doubt you're going to get a good, verified, professional interviewer if s\/he is willing to take that small of a cut.\n2. **Questionable authenticity of interviewers:** all it takes for someone to be an interviewer is to send Jake a LinkedIn profile from a convincing e-mail address that matches that person's profile name.\n3. **The interviewer's performance doesn't matter:** [Your interviewer can be complete crap and that's your loss.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/computerscience\/comments\/7wmp0k\/rant_i_feel_pretty_cheated_paying_for_this_mock\/) Jake doesn't assess the people he works with.

   "description":"I\u2019m about to graduate in may, 2019, with a bachelors degree in computer science, but I do not feel like I am fully prepared for the job market. I\u2019m hoping that I could become a full time software engineer, however I feel like there is so much for me to re-learn and get exposed to, before I would consider myself qualified. Not to sell myself short, I do have a more fulfilling resume than many of my peers who are in the same position, however I do not feel that my experiences resonates the duties that Will be required of me as a legitimate full time engineer. To clarify, I\u2019ve currently been an intern for a small startup for 6 months, however I only work 10 hours a week. The quality of work that I was provided with, doesn\u2019t reflect the time I\u2019ve been there. The internship experience has provided me with some exposure to both the backend and front end tasks, however not enough to the point that I would feel confident in my own skills. I\u2019ve performed some research from another company, where I programmed the logic code for a demo peer-peer blockchain network, but that\u2019s all That I was able accomplish, before funding ran out. I am the Vice President of the cyber security club, which had drastically improved my soft skills, but only provided me with some exposure to cyber security, and not something that I would feel confident performing in. I also helped organize and host a hackathon on campus with a group of students.  Lastly, I\u2019ve had some volunteer tutoring experience of a child\u2019s version of an Arduino. The only area in my resume that I seem to be lacking is that I do not have an amazing personal project that I could present, and have to rely on a project that I completed for a homework assignment. My biggest concern is that I know I do terrible in technical-based questions, which I believe is the result of my lack of understanding of basic concepts that I had simply not retained. Despite my exposure towards the entire software development process, I do not think I can program efficiently to save my life. Most of my accomplishments were the result of figuring stuff out using google, rather than my own problem-solving abilities. I am currently taking a data structures course to familiarize myself with older concepts, but I was wondering if there is anything that I should focus on within the next few months to improve myself as a programmer, and a potentially efficient software engineer ?

Why or why not? Keep in mind i know cyber security is booming but i heard it can be extremely stressful since one human error can cause a huge problem.\n\n2) Do you have ideas for side projects that would impress employers? I have an idea, but I am not sure if it would be enough.",

If you select it, your post will get removed and you'll receive a polite message directing you to r\/LearnPython and the Python discord. Ideally this will prevent the front page help spam\n* I Made This - this is contentious, but I believe that people should be allowed to show off what they've worked on. To start with, this will be allowed at all times. \n* Resource - if you find a cool library to use, awesome book to read, etc.\n* Editors \/ IDEs - for discussion about ~~pycharm and vim~~ I guess any editor\n* Web Development - a specific topic of discussion\n* Machine Learning - a specific topic of discussion\n* Big Data - a specific topic of discussion\n* Finance - a specific topic of discussion\n* Systems \/ Operations - a specific topic of discussion\n* Testing - a specific topic of discussion\n* Meta - for discussion pertaining to r\/Python itself\n\nI've based this on the sorts of things I have observed in r\/Python over the last 8 months. This is not an exhaustive list, and it could potentially be reduced or expanded as necessary. Please feel free to discuss the flair here or in a [Meta] post.\n\nFor instructions on filtering, check out our wiki: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Python\/wiki\/filters \n\nThis is a bit rough; I've copied it from another subreddit, and tried to rapidly edit in relevant things. If you experience an error with it, please let me know.\n\nNext steps:\n\n* I'm planning to have a moderator application form ready by end of week, and I'll start looking for more moderators.\n* I'll try to keep the modqueue clear until we add more people.\n* Please report things that slip through, especially things that are more appropriate for r\/learnpython. Please keep in mind that \"I made this\" style posts are *explicitly allowed* even if you don't like them, so don't report them; filter them out instead.\n\nEdit: I forgot something:\n\n> AutoModerator tries to avoid contradicting other moderators, and will not approve items that have already been removed by another moderator, or remove items that have already been approved by another mod.\n\nI'll have to automate this with a different tool.",

   "community_name":"computerscience",

   "description":"Hi y'all! I am currently preparing for interviews for a web dev position and I have typed up a study sheet. I'd like to share it here just in case any one else might be able to benefit from this! I know finding the right things to review can be intimidating, but this could be a good start. \n\nHappy Coding!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  **Difference between a Value Type and a Reference Type**\n\n* Value type: hold the data within its own memory allocation. Stored in the stack.\n* Value types can be created at compile time and stored in stack memory.\n* Value type: if assigned to another variable, the value is copied directly and both variables work independently.\n* Reference type:\u00a0 contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the real data. Stored in the heap.\n* Reference types are used by a reference which holds a reference (address) to the object itself.\u00a0\n* Reference type: assigning a reference variable to another doesn't copy the data, but instead creates a second copy of the reference, which refers to the same location in the heap as the original value.\n* reference type examples: Classes, Objects, Arrays, Indexers, Interfaces\n\n**What is an Interface?**\n\n* an interface is a specification for a set of class members, not an implementation.\u00a0\n* an Interface is a reference type and it contains only abstract members such as Events, Methods, Properties etc.\u00a0\n* you can think of an interface as an abstract class that contains only pure virtual functions. This implementation of the methods is done in the class that implements the interface.\n\n Difference between an Interface and a Class\n\n* A class is a full body entity with members, methods along their definition and implementation.\n* An Interface is just a set of definitions that you must implement in your Class inheriting that Interface.\n\n Multiple inheritance in .Net\n\n* .Net does not support multiple inheritance. This is why Microsoft introduced Interfaces - a solution for multiple inheritance.\n* .Net allows you to have a single inheritance, but you are free to implement as many interfaces as you wish.\n\n**Static Keyword**\n\n* Static classes and class members are used to create data and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the Class. The keyword static can be applied to the classes, field, method, properties, operator, event, and constructors.\n* they cant be inherited and these classes are sealed by default. Normally it is used to group related static methods in class.\n* the advantage of static keyword is that it will make your code a bit faster since no object creation is involved.\u00a0\n\n**Jagged Array**\n\n* An array which has elements of type array is called jagged array. The elements cam be of different dimensions and sizes.\n* AKA an array of arrays\n\n**Namespaces**\n\n* namespaces are containers for the classes.\u00a0\n* Used for grouping the related classes in C#.\n* uses the \"Using\" keyword.\n\n**Polymorphism**\n\n* provides the ability to a class to have multiple implementations with the same name.\n* two types: static (compile time) and dynamic (runtime)\n* method overloading is an example of static polymorphism. Overloading is the concept in which method names are the same with a different set of parameters.\n* method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism.\n* method overriding can be done using inheritance. With method overriding it is possible for the base class and derived class to have the same method\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Inheritance is a concept in which you define a parent class and child classes.\n* the child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class, but at the same time, they can also modify the behavior of the methods if required. the child class can also define methods of its own if it needs to.\n\n**Encapsulation**\n\n* a process of binding the data members and member functions into a single unit. In c#, a Class is the real time example for encapsulation because it will combine a various type of data members and member functions into a single unit.\n* Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.\u00a0\n\n**Abstract Classes**\n\n* Abstraction is the process to hide the internal details and showing only the functionality.\n* The abstract modifier indicates the incomplete implementation.\u00a0\n* the keyword abstract is used before the class or method to declare the class or method to abstract.\n* an abstract CLASS is never intended to be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier *abstract*\u00a0in the class definition.\n* abstract classes cannot support multiple inheritance.\n* cant be static.\n* classes marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes\n\n**Front End Best Practices**\n\n* indentation\n* semantic elements: elements with tags that clearly deifne the content included for both the dev and the web browser.\n* class and ID names: using both class and ID names are practical and relevant.\n* CSS reset: resets html elements to a consistent baseline\n* avoid inline style CSS\n* when to use inline style: HTML email, content management system content (wordPress, etc.), Dynamic content (HTML created or altered by JavaScript), older websites.\n* popular javascript frameworks: Angular, React, jQuery, Vue.js\n* naming variables: always use variable names that make sense. Use camelCase.\n* Comments are very important\n* Design for all Browsers and Devices: Responsive Web Design\n\n**Back End Best Practices**\n\n* \u00a0Name things well: intelligent names, descriptive, tells us what the solution is\n* use properties, not public variables:\u00a0 there will be intences where you wont be able to use a public variable and will have to use a public property\n* methods should do one thing: separation\u00a0of concern\n* camelCase\n* keep it simple\n* concat strings using $\"\" (uses less memory space)\n* avoid global variables: use app.config for data. uses less memory and can be changed at runtime\n* Use public modifier only when necessary: public method can be seen by other classes outside of its own class. Private modifier : can only be seen in that class.\u00a0\n\n**Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index**\n\n* Indexing is a procedure that returns your requested data faster from the defined table. Without indexing, the SQL Server has to scan the whole table for your data. By indexing, SQL server does the exact same thing when you search for context in a book\u00a0 by checking the index page.\n* Clustered index : the type of indexing that established a physical sorting order of rows. Defining a column as a primary key makes that column the clustered the Clustered Index of that table.\n* Non-Clustered : an index structure separate from the data stored in a table that reorders one or more selected columns. The non-clustered index is created to improve the performance of frequently used queries not covered by clustered indexes.\u00a0\n* The differences:\n   * In a table there can be only one clustered index or one or more than one non clustered index\n   * In a clustered index there is no separate index.\n   * In a non-clustered index there is a separate index storage for the index.\n   * Clustered is slower than non-clustered.\n\n**http Protocols**\n\n* hyper text transfer protocol\n* the underlying protocol used by the internet that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.\n\n**Difference between http and HTML**\n\n* http is a protocol\n* HTML (hypertext markup language) is a language.\n\n**Dependency Injection**\n\n* DI is a design pattern that allows us to develop loosely-coupled code.\n* The intent of DI is to make code maintainable.\n* DI helps to reduce the tight coupling among software components.\n* DI reduced the hard-coded dependencies among your classes by injecting those dependencies at runtime instead of design time.\n\n**Entity Framework**\n\n* EF is the framework ORM (object-relational mapping) that Microsoft makes available as part of the .Net development.\u00a0\n* Its purpose is to abstract the ties to a relational database, in such a way that the dev can relate to the database entity as to a set of object and then to classes in addition to their properties.\u00a0\n\n**MVC**\n\n* Model View Controller is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representation of information from the way that information is presented to or accepted from the user.\n* used to develop web applications\n* Model = application core (database records etc); View = the display that the user sees; Controller = manipulated the data gathered by the model.\n* Advantages:\n   * Separation of Concerns.\n   * Multiple view support,\n   * Change accommodation ( because the model does not depend on the views, adding new types of views to the system generally does not affect the model.\n   * More Control\n* [https:\/\/www.c-sharpcorner.com\/UploadFile\/puranindia\/ASP-NET-MVC-Interview-Questions\/](https:\/\/www.c-sharpcorner.com\/UploadFile\/puranindia\/ASP-NET-MVC-Interview-Questions\/)\n\n**SQL Stored Procedures**\n\n* prepared SQL code that you can save, so that the code can be resued over and over again.\n* you can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.\n\n**Stack vs Heap**\n\n* Stack = static memory\n* Heap = dynamic memory\n* The stack is more or less responsible for keeping track of whats executing in our code.\n* The Heap is more or less responsible for keeping track of our objects;\n* the stack is thought of like a stack of boxes and we can only access whats on the top of the stack and then throw it away.\n* anything can be accessed from the heap at any time.",

   "description":"Hey guys. I'm a CS major and a father. \nGrowing up, I loved playing games by Humongous games. Putt Putt ( Little purple car), Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam, Spy Fox etc. \n\nNow I'm in my 20's and I'm learning how to code. I also have a 3 year old daughter who also loves these same games since they ported them over to iOS and Android. \n\nPlaying them with her, I can visualize what the code would be like for the game. \n\nIs there any way I can check out this code?\n\nTLDR:  Is there any way I can view the raw code from  humongous games like putt Putt Putt or Freddi Fish?",

   "description":"One of the most powerful use-cases for a cryptocurrency is facilitating the ability to anonymously store and transact value.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin was due in part to the utility it brought to darknet marketplaces via \u201cpseudonymous\u201d wallet addresses. Initially, this allowed Bitcoin\u2019s users to transact value anonymously.\n\nAs Bitcoin became more popular, more resources were dedicated to understanding patterns of transactions between pseudonymous wallets. It is now well established that Bitcoin does not provide its users with the ability to transact anonymously. Because of this, a number of \u201cprivacy coins\u201d have been created with the goal of solving this problem.\n\nOn Tuesday at 12p PST, [ResearchHub](https:\/\/www.researchhub.com\/) will host a live e-Journal Club and AMA with George Kappos discussing his paper \u201c[An empirical analysis of anonymity in Zcash](https:\/\/www.usenix.org\/system\/files\/conference\/usenixsecurity18\/sec18-kappos.pdf)\u201d\n\nSign up here if you are interested in how experts perform network analysis on privacy-coin blockchains and would like to learn exactly how anonymous Zcash transactions are: [https:\/\/ama.researchhub.com\/georgekappos](https:\/\/ama.researchhub.com\/georgekappos)",

   "description":"I'm no expert programmer but I know very well that the two are different. I have previously coded in Java. This year at university, I had JavaScript in Computer which is my subsidiary subject. Most of my classmates referred to it as 'Java' and it bothered me a lot. I tired explaining the difference many times but they wouldn't stop. They hadn't done Java at all previously but still it wasn't technically correct to call it JavaScript\u200b as Java. The worst part is that I tried to clear this one of my friend and she said that nobody cares what it is called. \n\n\nBesides this, everyone's afraid of JavaScript and thinks that it's difficult. We also have HTML in our curriculum and everyone prefers it. I'm the only one who would gladly take JavaScript over HTML anyday. I know both the languages well but I'm more proficient in JavaScript. I was really frustrated when in our final practical exam, there was no question from JavaScript; only from HTML. \n\n\nAll this has really made me think a lot about continuing with computer as my minor next year. I have to drop one; and it's either this or physics. I'm really interested in computer languages but my classmates make it really hard. It's not fun when I'm surrounded by a bunch of technically challenged people. The worst part is that they get their way with the teacher. They even managed to cut out the CSS practicals (another thing that I really like and am good at). \n\n\nMaybe I'm overreacting. The thing is that I do want to continue with these languages but not as a part of my course. There must be alternatives; I could use some suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n",

A statement is true when it makes an `if` statement succeed.\n\nThe most interesting `example` of this is that `None or value` evaluates to `value`. This will really help me to avoid these kind of statements: `self.attrib = value if value is not None else other_value`\n\nI thought this would be nice to share.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/3914667\/python-false-or-none-vs-none-or-false)",

   "description":"I\u2019m one of the millions in Wuhan right now who is affected by this. It is heartbreaking to see comments here saying how we deserve it. \n\nYes. Some people are disgusting and uneducated, they eat everything that moves and have total disregard for health\/safety regulations. But most people aren\u2019t like that. Most of us are just normal folks living a normal life. We are just as angry at those exotic animal traders as you are, if not more. \n\nIt\u2019s CNY, and in case you\u2019re not familiar with the Chinese culture, let me first put into perspective it\u2019s importance. It\u2019s like thanksgiving and Christmas combined. Historical\/Traditional significance aside, for millions of people, CNY is the only time of the year where families get to reunite and have a home cooked meal together. It is more common than not for chinese people in more rural areas to go to cities to find better work opportunities. They work hard for the whole year, sending home the little money they earn to support their children and parents. Families don\u2019t get to see each other for a whole year and reunion dinner on CNY eve is something everyone looks forward to. \n\nThe coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year that families get to reunite. Doctors and nurses are working around the clock, many of them have not gone home in weeks; healthcare professionals across China are flying voluntarily to Wuhan to help; factory workers have resumed work due to the shortage of masks and protective suits; 3M and other companies are donating masks too; hotels across Wuhan have offered free accomodation to healthcare professionals whose home are too far away; chain convenient stores are providing free hot meals to hospitals and workers; delivery man have to give up their holidays to deliver food to families because we can\u2019t leave our homes; construction workers are working around the clock to build new hospitals... do all these people working tireless to save lives deserve to get affected and die too??? Those selfish exotic animal traders have taken away precious family time from all these people who are literally putting their lives in danger to help others, and yet on the Internet, these unsung heroes are being lumped together with them, criticised condemned and humiliated. It\u2019s really heartbreaking. Those people don\u2019t deserve any of it. \n\nAs of now, most of our fridges are still fully stocked from CNY, but what about in a week or even a couple of days when we run out of food? My parents just came back from the supermarket and many shelves are empty. Public transport have shut down completely, from today onwards vehicles unrelated to the containment of coronavirus will not be allowed on roads too, no one is allowed to leave Wuhan. So let me ask you, do all of us deserve this too? Especially during a time of supposed celebration. I\u2019m not even a permanent resident here, I am just home for the holidays after being away for more than a year. But now I can\u2019t leave to go back to Uni. I\u2019m sure there are many people in similar situations as me. I hope I\u2019m not coming off as playing the victim. I\u2019m merely trying to tell my side of the story. And I\u2019m so sorry the virus has now spread to other countries. I truly am very sorry. But not all Chinese are bad people. Not all are selfish and entitled and just downright disgusting human beings. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for you to say that we all \u201cdeserve\u201d it because of the terrible behaviours of some.",

This is made to be able to get people up and running with thier own free network to one another and communicating and transmitting files and data as fast as possible in an emergry situation. In the slides it gives a couple examples. Like when hurricane Katrina hit and no one could communicate with one another. Or in Egypt when the government turned off the internet and started killing all the protestors. That's what this is for.",

   "description":"Hello, it is my first semester on CS. I am 18, because of poor ed system I have not even sniffed at programming before. I am rather succesful at learning it over my other classmates tho. What I am wondering is wht steps should I take next? In Turkey CS is so new to Universities that only one University has it as a study (although we have CE and SE studying Universities in everywhere). And it just opened in 2014. So I am kinda one of the first of the kind. I am in a family who suffers from heavy debt that we can not pay because we can not earn enough so we have to go \u00fcn even more debt. So what should I do to start earning money with Moderate HTML and Begginner grade C knowledge?",

   "description":"Hello Redditors,\n\n7 years ago, I was a college student. My college doesn't teach me advance programming, but only basic of all programming language ( I learn from QBASIC, Visual Basic, Java, Cobol, C, C++, and more).\n\nI love C\/C++ back then, but I found some barrier while learning it. The barrier is: Different compiler and preprocessor while using different OS.\n\nSo I decided to learn one language that running in all platform. The first choice is Perl. I love because I can simplify and \"code golfing\" while code. But Perl is not my answer, because after 1 week writing the code, I forgot why I wrote in that way. I create many vapor code using Perl.\n\nSo, I need other solution for it. And my choice is Python.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy college doesn't teach me Python, so I decided to **pirate** [this book](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Learning-Python-5th-Mark-Lutz\/dp\/1449355730). For 1 month and 2 weeks, I learn that e-book.\n\nI also create some script for my private hobby (scrapping from online manga, automation file clean up), and much more.  \nAfter about 6 month practice with Python, I try to apply programming job using the knowledge I know.\n\nFor about 2 years works after that, I finish my college also pay all my college debt (with salary about $150 per month). 1 year after that, I own my first laptop (Yes, while I am on college, I don't have either PC or Laptop for learning, I either go to rent or my friend).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to present time ... My life is better, much better salary than before, and no debt. I also compensate for pirating the book by [buying that](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/2ud20FQ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR;\n\n\\- Python change my life from college student with full of debts into full time programmer\n\n\\- Its all about your will to learn, even without facility, you should find your way\n\n\\- Atone your sin",

   "description":"I have a logic puzzle:\n\ntom is taller than steve\n\nAdam is shorter than Steve\n\nAdam is the same height as Jill only if Adam is shorter than tom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrue or false: Adam is the same height as Jill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a really easy puzzle for us humans. We logically look through the statements and can see that Steve must be between tom and Adam, then make the logical leap that Adam is shorter than tom. Then we know that the if statement holds true and that Adam is indeed the same height as Jill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm trying to understand how a computer might solve this OTHER than brute force. My impressions is that languages such as prolog use a combination of backtracking and unification to basically set one variable as something and then try everything else to see if the constraints hold. Then if so, it moves to the next variable until it knows all of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is just very different from how we \"think\". My impression is that it make it harder for the computer to relate what it needs to sole the problem. Like lets say we removed \"Adam is shorter than Steve\". Then the puzzle becomes unsolvable because we don't have any information really about Adams height. A human can recognize this and say it. But a computer cannot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is my question: Is there any research into making a computer think like we do - relationally, spatially, so that it can know what it does not know and perform logical reasoning like we do? What should I look up if I want to learn more about this.",

I'm just sitting here like WTF haha... is this common or am I being a bit of a baby?",

   "description":"I wanted to share with the community an open source python package I had been developing since November. It is called Spacetime Engine.\n\n[github.com\/spacetimeengineer\/spacetimeengine](https:\/\/github.com\/spacetimeengineer\/spacetimeengine)\n\nMy name is Michael. I am a physicist who works as an engineer.  My story is that in October 2018 I was preparing to submit my first physics publication, which reviewed a particular cosmological model that I had been working with for some time. I was at the point where I had completed all of my research and was fully prepared. The only problem was that at the time I felt concerned that I may have made some mistakes which went unnoticed, so I decided to write a computer algebra software to check the veracity of my solutions so that I could feel confident in my results. After using this new utility, I realized I had made some fairly significant errors in my approach, and so the software apparently did it\u2019s job. At first I was quite frustrated because I had put  a significant amount of time into this solution, but I realized I had a new ability to correct my own errors and expand upon what I already knew. I was now able to study any solution, and not just the ones that interested me. In fact, anyone could study any solution to the Einstein field equations if they wanted to by using this software. For this reason I realized the research I wanted to publish was not yet ready to be submitted, but the software became the real publication. I then decided to polish, package, and publish the code into a form that was accessible, informative, and educational. If you are a student new to general relativity, a gravity researcher actively working with solutions to the Einstein field equations, or an engineer who is interested in importing some of the functionality, then this package should come in handy. I was not able to publish my physics research, unfortunately, but I felt that this project served as a good alternative, and perhaps had more potential value. If you have technical questions, use the Github tools to communicate with me. You can install the package with\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$ pip install spacetimeengine\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to thank the r\/Python community for maintaining a platform for people like me to share my work. Enjoy!",

   "description":"I'm a rising sophomore double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics as of now, and I was interested in eventually getting an internship with Apple. The internship I was interested in required, among other things, skill in C or C++. In some other job listings I've seen on Stack Overflow or LinkedIn ask for experience in C++ or some other language like Java or Python. \n\n\n\nI already am proficient with Java and Python, and very comfortable with Swift, but I was wondering if it is worth it as a computer scientist to learn C and C++ and their low-level memory management techniques. From what I gleaned on wikipedia, C++ is just an amalgamation of *too* many features, and C++ programmers just use a subsets of the language in practice. From this perspective, learning C++ when I already know some other languages seems optional and not very useful.\n\nWhat are your guys's thoughts on learning C or C++ for computer science enrichment?",

   "description":"The College of Engineering and Computer Science did a virtual open forum today. This is a summary of what was answered by the dean:\n\n**COVID19 Grades**\n\n\\- No decision made but talks are happening and there's a very high probability that students will have the **option** for credit\/no credit\n\n**Why does the college not list faculty names for class registration**\n\n\\- ECS offers a very limited number of sections for each class compared to other colleges on campus, so they have less flexibility. Takes time to track student demand and make decisions on number of sections offered and schedules for those classes. The department doesn't finalize schedules until a few weeks before class. The decision was made to prioritize flexibility to respond to student demand and moving parts involved with course scheduling.\n\n**Virtual Advising**\n\n\\- Information available at  [http:\/\/www.fullerton.edu\/ecs\/ecs-updates.php](http:\/\/www.fullerton.edu\/ecs\/ecs-updates.php)\n\n**Summer Classes**\n\n\\- Summer classes are online only, almost all classes will be 5 weeks long. Department chairs get to decide how labs work\n\n**Senior Design Projects**\n\n\\- Contact your instructor if you have questions\n\n**International Students**\n\n\\- Contact international students office\n\n**Internships\/On\/off-campus jobs over summer**\n\n\\- Contact career center, ECS specialist is Paula Verdugo\n\n**On campus lab usage**\n\n\\- Not available at this time\n\n**Issues with a specific professor**\n\n\\- Contact department chair\n\n**Tuition pricing or financial assistance**\n\n\\- There are ongoing talks regarding student fees, nothing regarding tuition. Normal resources (scholarships and such) available for financial assistance\n\n**Is the machine shop open to students**\n\n\\- No\n\n**EPP over summer**\n\n\\- No, might be offered at the end of this semester, will be offered at the start of fall semester.",

I\u2019m getting into the more serious classes now and finished my first week of C++ with almost no programming experience. I know it\u2019s just one week, but small victories feel good too. \n\nI read every word of the assigned reading, viewed every slide, watched every lecture, and worked through almost every example from the book. (Recommendation to beginner\u2019s: Read every word! Everything matters.) We started with 2 simple programs, which gave me some trouble, but I finally finished them earlier today. The experience was frustrating but very very satisfying. \n\nI\u2019m feeling pretty good about my classes. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s answered my previous CS questions. And special thanks to the user who helped me with discrete math. Have a good night everyone.\n\n",

   "description":"I made a research paper recommender for Machine Learning and Computer Science in general, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.\n\n###What is it?\n\nThe dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https:\/\/labs.semanticscholar.org\/corpus\/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains 1,666,577 papers, mostly in the computer science field. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. \n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/B4qdoCC.jpg\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OCgp0MV.jpg\n\n\n###Where is it?\n\nGithub\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/Santosh-Gupta\/Research2Vec\/blob\/master\/Research2VecPublicPlayGround.ipynb\n\nOr direct look to Google Colab\n\nhttps:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1-0ggLs2r-5nWDWb-TNWqR2osaiXqNEsL\n\n###What can you do with it ?\n\nYou can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)\n\nNow, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:\n\nYou can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.\n\nYou can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). \n\nFinally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. \n\n**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** \n\n### How important is this ?\n\nWhen I was in R&D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword\/phrasing in our queries.\n\nThere's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.\n\nI've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.\n\nEven the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.\n\n> \"As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough >enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/773epu\/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google\/dojjag2\/\n\nSo if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.\n\nHere's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.\n\nWord2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors\n\nhttps:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1803.05651\n\nBinary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment\n\nhttps:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1706.07479\n\nExact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.\n\n###How do I use it ?\n\nHere's a quick video demonstration:\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/tlutFm1meMs\n\nI tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/ first )\n\nHere's a step by step guide to help people get started\n\n**Step 1:** \n\nRun the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. \n\nhttps:\/\/snag.gy\/rmoCXO.jpg\n\n**Step 2:**\n\nFind the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\n\nGet either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers\/letters in the link. For example, in this link\n\nhttps:\/\/www.semanticscholar.org\/paper\/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov\/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3\n\nThe Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'\n\nUse the title(s) and\/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). If using the title to search, don't forget to use only lower case letters only. \n\nhttps:\/\/snag.gy\/3yjx2o.jpg\n\nThe EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. \n\n**Step 3:**\n\nInsert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. \n\nhttps:\/\/snag.gy\/AzeP91.jpg\n\nIf you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change this line \n\n`extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 + paper3 + paper4`\n\nand create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction\n\n    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   \n    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) \n    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   \n    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) \n\nFinally, run Section 4 to get a TSNE map of the recomendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. \n\n**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** \n\n### Other details\n\nSo it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in May 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 20 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. \n\nAs of right now, the recommender has 1,666,577 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. \n\n### Feedback greatly appreciated !\n\nI am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit (kinda like Facebook SentEval https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/SentEval ) that I can use to tune the hyperparameters. \n\nThis feedback will also be helpful in my future plans, where I am planning on incorporating several other measures of similarity, and then use a attention mechanism to weight them for a final similarity. One method of content analysis I would really like to use is Contextual Salience https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1803.08493. Another was something another Redditor just pointed out is cite2vec https:\/\/matthewberger.github.io\/papers\/cite2vec.pdf\n\nUsing a combo like this would help in one of the reoccurring hard search cases I encountered in R&D, which was trying to look up parameters of a particular method, when the method itself is not the focus of the paper. I was just actually encountering this issue when doing my project. I wanting to know more about what optimal hyperparameters others have found when working with embedding representations. This may not be the main topic of the paper, but it may have been described in the methods section of the paper. But this is hard to search for since paper searches mainly focus on the main subjects of the paper.\n\nOf course, I would very much appreciate whatever feedback, questions, comments, thoughts you have on this project. \n\n\n\n",

   "description":"In light of the recent Rape on campus, I wanted to open a thread about people who act strangely on Campus who may not be a student or staff member at CSUF. For example, if you sit outside in Campus you will most likely get asked about taking a survey for a class, or signing a petition, or donating money. I remember there were people last semester who came to the campus wearing red shirts who claimed to be apart of a church in Santa Ana asking for donations. Well that \"church\" was on the news last night being investigated for fraud. Then you have the Jehovah Witnesses who walk around campus claiming they are students who need to do an assignment about religion but are really trying to teach you about their religion. Then there is this heavy set African American guy who wears a backpack and approaches you asking about your day and then at the end he asks for money. The funny thing is is that that last guy keeps coming back to me whenever he sees me even though I tell him I'm busy or gets up to leave. Have any of you ever encountered anyone like this on campus? I feel that its annoying that people can't sit outside to study, read, or be on their phone without being bothered by someone. I mean I think Titan Walk is a free speech zone so I don't mind being asked for things there but when I am trying to find a quiet spot on campus besides the library, it gets really frustrating. The library is great but I need some fresh air every once in a while you know?",

When I was in Housing I was being harrassed and Housing told me there was no room to move me. Had to jump chain to the Dean and miraculously there was another apartment available. I couch surfed and slept in my car for a month while my abusive roommate had the entire room and Housing claimed they were full. Never told me about the Emergency Housing.  \n\n2. Then the next semester I got accused of cheating by a stupid TA and I fought it, but couldn't continue to because she did it 2 weeks before summer started. Her department took her side even though I had proof I didn't cheat. Still got put on probation... \n\nAny stories you've never shared?

To the guy who jizzed in the 1st floor library bathroom, learn to clean up after yourself.\n\nI just wanted to take a shit somewhere and I opened the stall to find enough jizz to feed an entire village of Africa. Not only that, but it was all over the floor, the toilet seat cover, the walls, everywhere EXCEPT the fucking toilet bowl. Is it that hard to aim your dick at the goddamn bowl before you nut? It's like someone exploded a bottle of ranch dressing all over the place. Fuck.\n\nAnd it smelled FUCKING HORRIBLE. What the fuck did you eat, six pounds of skunk carcasses? I opened that stall door and not only did I get assaulted by the sight of the brand new paint job on the walls and floor, but also by the stench, which was comparable to getting stabbed in the nostrils by a frozen and sharpened piece of dogshit --actually, I think I'd prefer the dogshit.\n\nYou put Chernobyl and Hiroshima to shame with the intensity of the nuclear catastrophe you unleashed upon this bathroom stall. I feel like being exposed to it has single handedly subtracted 7 years from my lifespan. I can feel my cells deteriorating as we speak. There are no words for the sheer emotional and mental damage you inflicted on my being. This jizz has offended not only my senses, but it has touched my very soul and brought me several steps closer to the eternal fires of Hell. Jesus Tittyfucking Christ, you broke me.\n\nEither learn to cum in the toilet bowl or just stop fucking nutting in this Catholic institution of learning. You are an adult, PLEASE nut somewhere other than the walls and floor and save our janitors the trouble of cleaning up your radioactive baby juice. I swear to fucking God, if I ever find out who you are, I am cutting your dick off and tossing it into the fires of an active volcano in the hopes that it will never hurt another living being ever again.\n\nFUCK you and your dick.",

   "description":"Yesterday (Halloween) morning, around 9:50am, I was at College Park, on my way to take a test for my 10am class. I had to get a scantron and thought that the vending machine in the hallway could take cards. The machine does not take cards and I did not have any cash on me.\n\nThere was about 10 minutes before the test and I did not have time to go across the street to the main campus. There was a girl standing by the machine and I asked her if I could borrow cash from her and I could venmo her. Without hesitation, she got me a scantron and refused to let me venmo her for it and told me \"go do well on your test.\"\n\nI know the scantron costs less than a dollar, but her willingness to help and her words of encouragement really made my day. I am inspired to be kind to others and will try to help those I can in my everyday life.\n\nI wanted to share this story in hopes that it will inspire you all to be as kind and generous as this student and hopefully, if she is reading this, say how grateful I am. Her words of encouragement really helped me to keep myself in a positive mindset during the exam.",

   "description":"It doesn't happen too often, but I'm 2 years into a CS degree and I do notice some.. sexism? discrimination? I am not really sure what the right word is. I had an advisor ask me if I was sure I wanted to pursue a STEM degree because not many women were in STEM degrees.  He suggested I consider the nursing degree.  I was in an Engineering class where another girl and I were the only females in the class, so the professor made us be partners (everyone else got to pick) because \"Women work better together\".  I've had plenty of inappropriate advances. I have had countless situations where I am never asked to pull my weight, like being assigned the smallest or easiest portion of a project, etc etc etc.\n\nThe only thing I can think of to do is to keep doing my best.  None of it makes me angry, and normally I just brush it off.  But it can be disheartening sometimes. I very much want to be taken seriously. \n\nI don't want to sound all social justice warrior here. I actually haven't talked to many other female programmers so I am just wondering...Is this just what the industry is like? Is the workplace any better about valuing people for their skill, rather than some factor like gender or race? ",

Honestly, today there were 4 tutors, but there were over 40 empty tables. When I approached the person at the sign in table, one of the tutors came at me in the most aggressive way possible. \n\nAll I learned from them was that the Area is \"reserved\" but the specifics of to who, what, and where seemed to be impossible to obtain from them. They referred me to their boss.\n\nDoes anyone know why and how they are able to get away with this? We should honestly have more first floor tables available for wheelchair, disabled, and injured students. Take tutoring upstairs! \n\nIf you do want to tutor downstairs, at least keep a balanced amount of tables. Approximately 10, but definitely not more than 40, this is ridiculous.",

No matter if it is simple discreet math problem or just setting up appropriate ecosystem for coding. I am just a sophomore who sometimes struggles with basic things, if not this(not only reddit) helpful community who knowns where i would ended up.\n\nToday's little event made me realize that this healthy community is the reason why computer science, which is very new field compared to other sciences, has evolved so dramatically fast and now have huge impact on almost everything. \n\nI am going to start Stanford's 'Programming Paradigms' from SEE and could not set up an environment on Unix. I was stuck badly and decided to write to lecturer who teaches the course. I wasn't expected him to answer my questions at all.... I mean, i'm just a guy from another end of the world having absolutely nothing to do with Stanford. In my suprise he took time and gave me detailed explanation to everything. I cannot even believe that i recieved mail someone like him. I'm still in shock.\n\nThis made me feel like i was a member of a big community where everyone is willing to help as much as possible, no matter who you are or where you are.\n\nJust wanted to thank to all of you who did similar things to others!! This little things really make difference!\n\nBes of luck to everyone.",

So if I do decide to go down this route, should I slow down my graduation or take a year off and do research after I graduate or will 2 years of research be enough?\n* What was your experience doing a PhD if you did one? Was it worth it in the end?\n\nAnyways, I'm just really lost right now so any information would help. Thanks!",

Also looking for some kind of big book of pseudocode. \n\nI\u2019m still pretty new to CS so I\u2019m trying to get as much practice and experience as possible. Looking for examples that I can refer to so I build good habits from the get go. \n\nThanks everyone! \ud83d\udc99",

Then I google how to do it and stackoverflow tells me bricks exist and they are used to build walls. \n\nThen I make bricks out of the shit and it sort of works but it still smells like shit and breaks down if I try to put a roof on top of it.\n\nI hope you understand what I am trying to say.

I want a leg up and some extra edge when school starts so I can hit the ground running. Does anyone have some advice as to what I should study before hand or any courses, books, videos, etc. that I should look into?

Long story, won't get into it, but basically I've been on the CS track while working full time in an unrelated job for the past four years. There's been stops and starts, and the consequence is that even though I only have 6 credits left, I haven't actually done much coding at all in a few years now.\n\nI'm pretty confident that I'm a good worker, a good communicator and a good learner but I feel like if I was put on the spot today in an interview I would have a really hard time looking like I've learned anything or can do anything related to CS. Because of the pressures of working and going to school while dealing with life generally, I have basically no portfolio of things I've coded, at least since very basic exercises way back when. The divide between what my piece of paper implies I know and what I feel like I actually know seems really wide.\n\nPart of it feels like imposters syndrome, but I'm also convinced part of this anxiety is based in a real decay of my knowledge due to the non traditional nature of my schooling.\n\nSo the basic question is: what are the fundamentals I need to be able to demonstrate for an entry level position? Knowledge of data structures? Do I *have* to have a portfolio or github for an entry level position? I'm certainly not looking to get into highly competitive positions at one of the more prestigious companies in Seattle or the Bay, and I definitely plan to leverage what I am confident about, but certainly I'm sure there's fundamentals I need to not get laughed out of the door anywhere.",

   "description":"Hey guys! I am about to enter my second semester of college as a computer science major. Throughout my first semester, I dove into the C++ language and learned to code. I actually really loved it! As much of this stuff really interests me, I'd like to think I'd have a career with computer science. With growing demands for CS related jobs, people have told me as soon as I get a masters degree, I'd have a good job within months. \n\nNow this all sounds great, but I'd really like to know what some if these \"jobs\" are. Can you guys give me some examples about what type of careers a CS major would go into? Any careers with coding emphasis (I love writing code so far) I would like to know of as well. \n\nThank y'all ",

I have a job and another summer class to worry about and can't always study. Recently, we were given a project and I am having a hard time trying to figure it out. I feel so stupid. I started early because I didn't understand the prompt. I asked all the kids in my class and they haven't even started. But seem not worrried. I asked my professor for certification and he could barely explain it to me simply. No one in my class seem worried about how fast we are moving because apparently they've already been over some of the topics. However, I'm a guest student at this university, at my home university we haven't been over these subjects. I just feel so stupid and discouraged. Apparently I'm on the right track for my homework. But I don't feel like I'll get everything right in time.\n\n\nEdit: I understand what's going on it the class for the most part. Its just that we have a project due and none of it makes sense to me. Simple problems are fine. But it's like its way too advanced for me.",

   "description":"RIP Moore's Law; you had a good run.\u00a0\n\nAt least that's what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes. The executive, who co-founded graphics-chip maker Nvidia, on Wednesday declared that \"Moore's Law isn't possible anymore.\"\n\nA key part of semiconductor manufacturing is shrinking the components called transistors, the extraordinarily tiny electronic switches that process data for everything from the clocks in microwave ovens to the\u00a0artificial intelligence algorithms\u00a0running in our phones.\u00a0\n\nLarge play-pause toggle\n\n00:1100:15\n\nLearn More\n\nVideo:\u00a0Nvidia CEO demos next-generation computer graphics at CES 2019\n\nIntel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 predicted a steady, two-year cadence of chip improvements that would double a processor's performance every couple of years. Moore's Law became more than a guideline for computer processor manufacturing. It's instead evolved into a shorthand definition for innovation at regular intervals, and has become a self-fulfilling prophecy driving the tech industry. Those regular improvements in iPhones, Samsung Galaxy smartphones and various other devices are thanks to Moore's Law.\u00a0\n\nBut as the scale of chip components gets closer and closer to that of individual atoms, it's gotten harder to keep up the pace of Moore's Law. It's now more expensive and more technically difficult to double the number of transistors -- and in return, the processing power -- for a given chip every two years.\u00a0\n\n\"Moore's Law used to grow at 10X every five years [and] 100X every 10 years,\" Huang said during a Q&A panel with a small group of reporters and analysts at CES 2019. \"Right now Moore's Law is growing a few percent every year. Every 10 years maybe only 2X. ... So Moore's Law has finished.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.cnet.com\/google-amp\/news\/moores-law-is-dead-nvidias-ceo-jensen-huang-says-at-ces-2019\/\n\n",

   "url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Python\/comments\/bx3yn9\/lets_talk_about_learning_posts\/",
   "description":"## The problem\n\nA while ago, many people got together and asked the moderators to ban \"how do I do this?\" style posts on r\/Python. The moderators listened, because this was a popular request; \"how do I do this?\" posts are subject to removal. We direct people towards r\/LearnPython and to the [Python Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/python) (which is a great learning resource filled with great people, by the way, check it out). The fact that we remove these posts has made a number of people unhappy about things. \n\nThe people who are most unhappy are (quite understandably) the people who have their questions removed. I've been told that people frequently feel like they do not get answers on r\/LearnPython and that even when things are removed here, they get better answers.\n\nThe next most unhappy group are people who strongly feel like these questions should be removed, and that the moderators don't remove them quickly enough. That's a valid concern; we remove dozens every day, but there's frequently a question in the queue that people want to have answered.\n\nThe next most unhappy group is me. At one point, I actually took part in this subreddit in a reasonable way, but about 99% of what I do now is remove questions from people who want help, and who *may not receive that help*. Moderating is generally a pretty thankless job, and this is one that is especially disheartening because I don't really believe that removing these is particularly helpful.\n\n## I propose an alternate solution\n\nSomething a number of subreddits do is to enforce a flair requirement for posts. There are a lot of benefits to this: it helps with searchability, filterability, organization (I realize that those are secretly all the same benefit, shhh).\n\nI propose that we enforce flair requirements for all posts. To do this, we can use u\/AssistantBOT. AssistantBOT helps by gently asking people to add flairs to their posts; for mobile users, you can reply to the bot, and the bot sets the flair for you. It also provides a monthly breakdown on the flairs that are used.\n\nI've used this bot on other subreddits, and it helps out significantly. If everything is categorized, it is trivial to filter out or search for the things that you are interested in. If you want to track Python Official releases, there could be a flair for that; if you want to avoid \"Show and Tell\" style posts, you could filter that out. The bot is simple and easy to use and works with old reddit, new reddit, mobile reddit, and all the apps that I've come across.\n\nPlease let me know what you think in the comments.\n\n## Maybe some clarification is in order\n\nI want to clarify some things. If we go down this route, my suggestion is that whenever someone tags something with \"help\" text, then they would automatically get a message that explained the following:\n\n* It's probably a better idea to try r\/LearnPython and the Python Discord first because they're both about helping people. r\/Python is **not a dedicated help forum**\n* It's also a good idea to check StackOverflow\n* Asking for help is a two way street. Don't post pictures of code, and don't expect people to do homework.\n\nThere are some [interesting suggestions](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Python\/comments\/bx3yn9\/lets_talk_about_learning_posts\/eq3pe70\/) from u\/flyinglotus123 - check them out too!\n\nI also want to stipulate that this would be on a trial basis. If we stopped removing these things, and then the subreddit transitioned into mostly help questions, then we would revert. I think there would **necessarily** be a test period, and it might be worthwhile to have certain parts of the year (ie September) where we simply direct people to other places.",

   "description":"So I've been programming with python as a hobby for the last few years. Never used a debugger, always just used print statements and with f strings it seems even easier.\n\nI'm working on a console app to spit out DND NPCs using complex nested json. Headache. Keep getting caught with key errors etc. I've been meaning to try the debugger for a while. So I fine a quick tutorial and its sooo easy I'm a fool for wasting time with print.. Gah!!\n\nFor those who have been avoiding it for whatever reason here is a really quick primer:\n\n= If you're running 3.7+ (I think) just wack in a breakpoint() close to your problem area\n\n= Run the programme. You'll be dropped into the debugger at that point.\n\n= Commands I've used:   \n\nlist - gives you a couple of lines above and below the current line\n\npp <something> - prints out that something, this really helps with those awkward data bugs\n\nnext - goes to the next line\n\nskip - skips going to the function call, but still runs the function\n\nThat's all I've been using so far. Anybody go some useful commands post away.",

   "description":"Hey, I\u2019m a first year undergrad CS student. After the first semester, I\u2019ve found some gaps in my understanding which I believe lie in my understanding of knowing how, when and where to implement basic sorting algorithms for various data structures. I have already purchased SICP before and was considering giving some of the chapters a thorough read over the Christmas break. However, I recently learned of Donald Knuth\u2019s AoCP. So my question is, in terms of learning the algorithms commonly used to sort data structures, which book does a better job at providing good explanations along with thoughtful exercises? \n\nI am also conscious that this could just be a waste of time\/inefficient and I might be better of working through HackerRank questions instead and ensure I fully understand the solutions to questions I am unable to complete, so any advise on what you believe would be best to do over the remaining 2\/3 weeks of my break would also be really appreciated! :)",

   "description":"[https:\/\/github.com\/vascofazza\/8bit-cpu](https:\/\/github.com\/vascofazza\/8bit-cpu)\n\nHi all,\n\nAs a Computer Scientist and an electronic passionate, I was always intrigued by the complexity of computer architectures and I always wondered if I could build a CPU myself from scratch. There are so many smart devices and constantly increasingly complex circuits and computing devices coming out every day that we are now used to consider this technology as a black box, impossible to replicate or even understand at a fine level.\n\nThis is the motivation behind my home-made 8bit CPU project I designed and built during the past weeks as the COVID-19 situation gave me a bunch of spare time. Moreover, this is also the first time I designed my own PCB so it was a double fun experience.\n\nThe peculiarity of this project is that it is entirely composed of simple logic circuits (74HCT ICs), with no microprocessors or complex parts. \n\nThe key feature of this CPU is that it is fully debuggable and shows you what\u2019s happening in the CPU at any time. You can input simple programs by hand and go through the execution step-by-step by manually pulsing the clock and see how the signals and data flow through the CPU to accomplish the given operation.\n\nI think this is a quite powerful learning tool if you\u2019re interested in how computers and computation work, especially because it turned out to be way more complicated once you face the implications of dealing with impedance, the inductance of the circuit and other basic electronic problems that were not addressed by the initial schematic.\n\nAt the moment I built the version 1 of the CPU, I have already fixed up some little problems I encountered on the way and improved the design with version 2, already available on GitHub. There you can find all the schematics and PCB layout in KiCad format, as well as the code, a demo video and a bit of explanation.\n\nHere you can find a demo of the CPU in action solving a variety of problems such as the Fibonacci sequence, finding prime numbers and sorting.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R\\_gflIunANo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R_gflIunANo)\n\nPlease star the repository and follow me on GitHub and Twitter (@fscozzafava) to stay tuned with the updates on the V2.0!",

Then, learning Python was like picking up the bass after already knowing guitar. \n\nMy younger brother just started the program at the university, and I feel like he is being shortchanged a bit. I see the argument as Python has less of a barrier to entry. \n\nIf you know both C++ and Python, which one did you learn first? In hindsight would you have switched the order you learned them? Does only learning Python make you miss out the things learning a lower level language can teach you?\n\nI'm not looking for an argument on which language is better; I simply would like to hear your experience in learning Python as I try to understand of pedagogy of programming.

   "description":"http:\/\/exercism.io\n\nThis is a problem I've faced multiple times. \n\nAs someone with a couple of years of programming experience in multiple languages, most websites that teach you a new language do so in a painfully boring manner.\n\nThey all follow the same basic pattern - how to declare variables, constants, how to write for loops, switch cases, structs, and then the last 4-5 chapters are dedicated to meaty stuff like Goroutines and Channels.\n\nA chapter about, say, variables, is full of obscure specific rules you're never going to remember, as someone looking at the book\/website for the first time.\n\nThis makes learning a new language a very dry experience. I've lost interest in a new language, say Haskell or Erlang, multiple times, because by the time I mow through the first 5 chapters, all I've learned is declaring variables and functions, but all my interest has been sapped out, with repetitive examples like fibonacci and factorials.\n\nI randomly stumbled upon exercism.io, and I found it really cool!\n\n* They have problem sets for all languages\n* They have a CLI tool, which means you can fetch exercises, and upload solutions without leaving your terminal, unlike say, codeforces\n* I assume there is some sort of graded difficulty, because the couple of problems I tried were 2-4 liners\n* They encourage a system, where people can check out each other's submissions and see different ways to achieve the same thing. They encourage you to participate, and leave comments\/suggestions on other people's solutions. No one seems to care much for the easier problems, I'm not sure how good the community support is for the harder ones.\n* The problems are not algorithmic in nature. With algorithmic problems - you're only using basic primitives like arrays, loops and recursion, but the examples here require you to understand and interact with various libraries that come with the language.\n\nApologies if this is a fairly well-known platform, but I just came across it, and found it the best way to learn a new language as an experienced programmer.\n\n**Edit**: Typo in title, sorry, URL at the top of the post is the correct one.",

   "description":"I am NOT a developer.  But, I've tinkered with programming (in BASIC, Visual Basic, Perl, now Python) when needed over the years, starting in my teens during the 80's and throughout my career, and had at least entry level courses in COBOL(in about 1990), C, and Java (in about 2009) while getting my degree.  (I was somewhat of a nontraditional student.)\n\nToday I decided that I needed to script something, and hoped that *learning* how to do it in Python was going to take me significantly less time than doing it manually - with the benefit of future timesavings.\n\nNo, I didn't go from 0 to production in a day.  But if my coworkers will leave me alone, I *might* be in production by the end of the day tomorrow.\n\nThe last thing I used to scratch an itch like this was Perl in about 2013.  Like with Python, I was learning as I went.  And in that case - while some parts weren't bad, other parts were like running barefoot over sharp glass.  I have working Perl from back then that I still don't *quite* understand bits of, because the best I could do is take someone else's example and massage it for my needs in some places.  (In fairness, what I was doing there was a bit more complex, but it still wasn't rocket science.)\n\nWhat I'm working on today isn't super complex - I'm taking some user input, making some decisions based on that input, reading a .csv, and will ultimately output a json file - but I've been able to easily understand everything I've done so far.  I've done a bit of googling around the json and csv bits, and that seems pretty easy too.  But putting together what I've done so far has just been a complete joy.\n\nThe syntax is so wonderful - it took me a couple of minutes to realize, for instance, that there was no \"wend\" or similar for a \"while\" loop, that merely the end of a code block would serve the same purpose.  But when I did I immediately thought \"wow, of course not - how efficient is that?\"   I feel like that's a big part of what I'm enjoying - things that maybe should be able to be implied rather than explicitly typed in or stated, actually *are* implied in many cases.  It feels like there's a lot less in the way of required punctuation, that's for sure.\n\nOverall it feels natural, intuitive, and relatively easy to understand and write the code for the basic things I'm doing - I haven't had this much fun doing stuff with code since the days fooling around with BASIC in my teens.\n\nWell, thanks if you actually read this far.  I've just found this to be so fun and exciting I had to share it with folks who might care.  I think I'm going to be looking for excuses to script things with Python going forward.  :-)\n\n\n**Edit:**  Wow, interesting responses in the comments.  Seeing what the community here is like just fans the flames.  Thanks all!\n\n\n",

   "description":"Hi guys! You might already know that I released a free and open source book on Intermediate Python. The name of the book itself is also [intermediate Python](http:\/\/book.pythontips.com). After my [last](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Python\/comments\/3hbb46\/i_just_released_alpha_version_of_intermediate\/) post the book received a lot of patches and it is in a whole lot better shape now. It also received a LOT of positive response from the community. It remained on the front page of [Hacker News](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=10075078) and \/r\/Python. It is currently a [trending](https:\/\/github.com\/trending?l=python) project on [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/yasoob\/intermediatePython) under the Python tab. I am happy to say that it has entered beta stage now. This is the best time to take a look if you haven't already.\n\nMoreover, if you want to add anything to the book or just want to polish it further then you are more than welcome to submit a Pull request on GitHub.\n\nI just wanted to write a quick note that a lot of people asked me last time whether I accept donations. I wasn't accepting donations untill recently. I have uploaded the latest build of the book on [Gumroad](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/intermediate_python) so if you feel like tipping me then you can buy the donation version of the book from [Gumroad](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/intermediate_python). It would mean a lot to me and would help me to continue writing free quality content.\n\n**Links:**\n\n- [HTML](http:\/\/book.pythontips.com)\n- [EPUB](http:\/\/readthedocs.org\/projects\/intermediatepythongithubio\/downloads\/epub\/latest\/)\n- [PDF](http:\/\/readthedocs.org\/projects\/intermediatepythongithubio\/downloads\/pdf\/latest\/)\n- [Donate](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/intermediate_python)\n- [Blog](http:\/\/pythontips.com)",

   "community_name":"computerscience",
   "url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/computerscience\/comments\/9ah5k8\/my_girlfriends_coworker_is_an_awful_coder_and\/",
   "description":"Hi guys. So everyone in this post (me, her, the coworker) is 20\/21 and a junior in college. She works for a MechE lab doing computer science work, so her boss isn't much help because he doesn't know much of anything about CS. \n\nMy girlfriend just started coding last year. When she started working at this job, she didn't know what OOP was. She's come a huge way in a short time and really has a knack for this stuff. I'm really proud of her because it can be hard to play catchup.\n\nAnyways, onto this coworker. So since she is new to programming, he did most of the coding on their project at the beginning and she did most of the algorithm work. Now that she is in her junior year and knows what she's doing, she's been contributing more. She's thinking of submitting the project to a journal and writing a paper to go along with it, and has been looking back through the code to make sure it is journal ready. \n\nHer coworker's code is AWFUL. He also kept moving the code to his private repo instead of the lab repo (why?), overwriting her changes and he made over 200 commits in only a couple months (worth noting that this project only has like 3 files...wtf dude). She asked me to look it over because she wanted to refactor it and wanted to know if I had any input. I swear, she has to rewrite all of it. I'm not even being dramatic, the two paragraphs goes through what I mean but is totally skipable if you don't care, it's mostly me being sad about this code. \n\nSo as part of their code they have two objects that I would assume would inherit from something. Like Shape --> triangle, square. He has one class, Shape. He has you pass the type (triangle vs square) into the constructor, then if type = triangle, declare one set of variables, otherwise, declare a different set. This class has two methods, one method for each type. If you call a method on the wrong type, it throws a runtime error. WHAT.\n\nIn the main code, he also iterates through a list AFTER clearing it. Why? He calls a function on each list item with the word \"get\" in the title. That function doesn't return anything, or use pass by reference. That function ALSO calls a \"get\" function that returns nothing and doesn't edit any values. Huh? \n\nSo yes. The code is a mess and looking at it made me want to cry. No journal would ever accept this in the state it's in and she honestly needs to probably start from scratch. He didn't even follow the algorithm. This coworker though, thinks he is gods gift to the earth. He insists on having all the code on his private repo, instead of a lab repo where everyone has equal access. The prof even told him to have his code in the lab repo, but he moved it back to his! What! He doesn't comment or document properly, and whenever she tries to make (much needed) changes he commits and overwrites them. He also purposely leaves her out of email chains concerning the project (even though it was her project to begin with, and her idea), and talks to the professor behind her back. To the prof's credit, whenever he conveniently forgets to use the CC button he brings her back in, and the next reply she's out again. **Another thing - he doesn't even work at the lab anymore!!** She can't talk to her boss about him, because he's not his boss anymore! He told her and the prof that he \"doesn't have enough time\" to do the paper, and that she will have to do it on her own. **But he's still happily making changes to the repo (that he won't move off his account), usually like one line change \/ commit. My gf is already planning to do a total refactor of the code, but we're afraid that he'll just undo the changes**. My dad (in the CS industry for years) thinks we should talk to the prof and get the coworker kicked off the project, or fork the repo into the lab repo and ignore his changes from now on. My gf hates confrontation and thinks this is \"too aggressive\". I think that she should basically tell him to screw off, fork the repo without him being a contributor and redo the code properly from scratch. Like, he doesn't work there anymore, why is he making changes? \n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation? Is there anything short of forking the repo that she can do? ",

I mentioned buying him a raspberry PI and he thought that was a great idea, but since I already mentioned that I was hoping I could get some ideas for similar gifts so that I might surprise him. Help this pre-med major out, I know nothing about computers but I know my bf would love a gift he can use practically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance :)",

   "description":"I would like to start out by give you a quick summery of my situation. I am starting my second year of college working towards my B.S. I\u2019ve been working with code for 3 years and now I am starting to ask my self, \u201c where do I want to go with this.\u201d \n\nAs I am sure you know there is  no such thing as one type of developer. From front to back end and ever language in between, the industry is a fast evolving and vast place.  I feel I am at the point in my career where I need to decide where I would like to end up and want kind of work I would like to do. The creative part of me wants to learn bender and finish the unreal class I bought online, and the logistical  side of me  says start reading that C book and learn SQL. \n\nLeading me to my questions. \n\n1 -where do you think the industry is heading and what kinds of developers companies will be looking for in the future.\n\n2 -If you could do it all over again what would you have done differently. \n\n3- How do I set myself apart from everyone else.\n\n4 - Any other advice for a programmer at the start of their career.

Choosing to major in CS was a big leap for me since I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d like it or be good at it. \n\nI\u2019ll be entering my Sophomore year of college in a week, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with my choice to major in CS. I love learning about algorithms and coding (so far I\u2019ve learned Python and a bit of Java). At this point, a lot of my classes are still generalized, and I\u2019m not sure what I want to specialize in (definitely something software related), but I love what I do. \n\nWomen in CS, what\u2019s your story?  Why did you choose CS, what is your career like, and does the fact that the field is mostly men affect you in any way? Let me know! :)",

What were some of the early difficulties you had when learning and gaining experience?\n\n4. How was your experience when first entering the workforce?\n\n5. Was it difficult to get a job, if so, what do you think you needed to work on?\n\n6. What are some traits and talents that are really beneficial to have in your work?\n\n7. If you were to tell your college self one thing that would make your life easier, what would it be?\n\n8. Do you use skills you learned while studying computer science in your life at home?\n\n9.
