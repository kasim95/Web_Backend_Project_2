It's like the proverbial frog in the pot of water. If you heat up the pot slowly enough, the frog will never notice that he's being made into a stew and jump out of the pot. With a Boil the frog playlist you can do the same, but with music. You can generate a playlist that will take the listener from one style of music to the other, without the listener ever noticing that they are being made into a stew.\n\nI'm using it right now for the first time, so I can't really comment on the validity of their claim... but it's certainly a really damn cool idea. I'll give an update if my \"from Maya Jane Coles to Boris\" mix actually worked out.\n\n[and here's the link to Boil the Frog so you can try for yourself](http:\/\/static.echonest.com\/BoilTheFrog\/)",

   "description":"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We\u2019re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.\nHead over to http:\/\/www.verizonprotests.com\/ for more info.**\n\n**WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING?**\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https:\/\/www.techdirt.com\/articles\/20171120\/11253438653\/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY?**\nNet neutrality is the [basic principle](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2014\/05\/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate\/361809\/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\n**WHY VERIZON STORES?**\nThe new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/7\/12\/15959932\/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\n**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**\nAjit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\n**HOW CAN I JOIN?**\n[Click here](https:\/\/events.battleforthenet.com\/#eventType=protestrally) and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http:\/\/act.demandprogress.org\/event\/team-internet\/create\/), and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http:\/\/battleforthenet.com\/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",

The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com)**\n\nWe're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won\u2019t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.\n\n**Please, head over to https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.\n\nTo reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.\n\nWhen you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: \n> I support \"Title Two\" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.\n\nWe also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https:\/\/www.battleforthenet.com\/#join\n\nThanks.",

Do they pay the bots they set up to grab the tickets? \n\nedit: yes I know I spelled popping up wrong\n\nedit 2: I have seen some tickets for now 6x\/7x the price of the original although these were only a few so far\n\nedit 3: sorry for the slightly colourful language in the title I was and still am angry at the situation",

   "description":"Hello! \n\nI remember staring at bitcoin a few years ago. When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I thought that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!\n\nToday, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don't believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it \ud83c\udf4d The Pineapple Fund.\n\nYes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)\n\nSo far, The Pineapple Fund has\/is:\n\n* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.\n\n* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa\n\n* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more\n\n* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. \n\nIf you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)\n\n# \ud83c\udf4d https:\/\/pineapplefund.org\/ \n\nAll transactions are posted on the website for full transparency :)\n\n-----\n\nedit: **Pineapple Fund does not donate to individuals. Please do not post your addresses or PM.**\n\nedit 2: Thanks for the gold! Highlighting new comments is a really useful feature <3 ",

At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.\n\nI  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https:\/\/puu.sh\/BhjCz\/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK\n\nLocalbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https:\/\/puu.sh\/BhmDT\/0a136c253b.png)\n\nSince then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months\n\nWhen contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http:\/\/puu.sh\/BhmJU\/01610eaef4.png)\n\nWhen contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http:\/\/puu.sh\/BhmIn\/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.\n\nI emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.\n\nPolice official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https:\/\/puu.sh\/BhmOd\/9045da5342.png)\n\nNational Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.\n\nAfter 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http:\/\/puu.sh\/BhmTD\/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https:\/\/puu.sh\/BhmXK\/a213a8d27b.png)\n\nI knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.\n\nAlmost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.\n\nReason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.\n\nNow I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at \u20ac10.000 to  \u20ac15.000 for civil proceedings,\n\nFinnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court\n\nIf you are a victim of this or you can help please get in touch.",
